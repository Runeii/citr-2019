  "body": "Channeling the spirit of Springsteen and 60’s beach-pop, Washington D.\n\nC. trio **Nude Beach** released on of the essential records of 2012 in the form of **_II_**. Chaotic, frenetic and unashamedly catchy, they’re a band that are nigh on impossible to not love, as shown by the new video for recent ‘single’ _Walkin’ Down My Street_. Capturing the very essence of the group and their manic live shows, it’s three minutes of beer guzzling, pizza munching, sweat drenched mayhem, and boy is it great.",
