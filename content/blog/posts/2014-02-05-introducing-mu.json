  "body": "_Our adventures in the tragedies of youth._\n\nMØ, NO, NONONO and now MU. Boy, things are getting confusing. Vancouver duo **MU**, comprised of Francesca Belcourt and Brittney Rand are rather special, as they show on their debut self titled EP. Four tracks of dreamy synth pop, it’s perfectly inkeeping with their immaculate visuals. Comparison wise, they’re likely to receive the Say Lou Lou nod, yet there’s a density to their sound that goes beyond purely pop music, for instance the child’s laughter sampled on Everything, which then flows expertly into a uniquely crafted ‘chorus’ of sorts. Check out the full EP below, including personal favourite _Big Star_.",
