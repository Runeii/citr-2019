Orlando based duo **Sæs**, comprised of Jennifer and Michael (I’ll let you find out their previous musical ventures for yourself) have released two stunning debut tracks, _Passed Out (It’s Night Time)_ and _Alcanzame_. With Jennifer taking the lead on vocals, there’s a swirling, majestic yet unpredictable vibe to both tracks, with touches of Cocteau Twins and The XX, most notably with the dual vocal sections on Passed Out. Check out both tracks below, and keep up with **Sæs** on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/saesmusic).",
