Don’t ask me what the heck is going on though, narrative-wise – to me it seems like Von Trier was asked to direct an M&S advert but forgot to put some food in it. Either that or a post apocalyptic Wimbledon…see what you think though:\n\n_Watch the video for Pencil Pimp below. Pencil Pimp is out now on 12″/download via Hotflush, and their self titled debut is due November 21st on CD/LP/download._",
