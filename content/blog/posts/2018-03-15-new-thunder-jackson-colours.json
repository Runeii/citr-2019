  "body": "Having formed following a random encounter in a LA taxi, Thunder Jackson announced their arrival with the fantastic _Guilty Party_ a few months back, and have now followed it up with the equally as brilliant Colours.\n\nBrilliantly over the top, almost like Jungle crossed with Prince, Colours is one of the most ambitious and memorable singles I’ve heard thus far in 2018. Keeping information purposefully close to their chests, it’ll be fascinating to see how the rest of the year unfolds for them. Check out Colours below and previous single, Guilty Party.",
