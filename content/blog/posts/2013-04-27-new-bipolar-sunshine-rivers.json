  "body": "**Bipolar Sunshine** continues his boyish, indie-centric exploration with this frantic and at times glorious new jam, _Rivers_.\n\nPerhaps more than his last 2 efforts, the focus, at least sonically, is very much on fun. The melodies are catchy, the breakdowns satisfying and every drop is predictable yet thoroughly admirable.\n\n_ “been low, but I’ve been higher’_ – the tracks final message sums up the track perfectly, sugary sweet, but only in memory.\n\n_Rivers_ is taken from **Bipolar Sunshine**‘s debut EP ‘_Aesthetics_‘ released 17th June 2013.",
