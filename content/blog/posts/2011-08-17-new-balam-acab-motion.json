  "body": "Having already cemented his name as one of the artists of the year with his ambient dubstep influenced tracks, **Balam Acab** has dropped another cut that is set to feature on his upcoming full length LP.\n\n_Motion_ has a soulful vibe to it, that stirs imperceptibly beneath the languid synths and looped samples, with the first minute providing a fitting introduction for the rest of the track. It’s atmospheric yet strikingly engaging; showing that whilst this young producer may be relatively inexperienced, he certainly knows how to compose and manipulate his music. Check out _Motion_ below, and watch out for **Balam Acab’s** full length LP **_Wander / Wonder_** which drops 29th April on [Tri Angle Records](http://tri-anglerecords.com/).\n\n [Balam Acab – Motion](http://soundcloud.com/tri_angle_records/motion) by [TriAngleRecords](http://soundcloud.com/tri_angle_records)",
