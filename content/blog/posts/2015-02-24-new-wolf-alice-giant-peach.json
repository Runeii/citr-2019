  "body": "Having debuted this track in a [VEVO Dscvr live session](http://admin.</p><p>crackintheroad.com/music/30458-video-wolf-alice-giant-peach) earlier in the year, **Wolf Alice** have released the studio version of their massive new single _Giant Peach_. Lifted from their debut album, **_My Love Is Cool_**, out 22 June, arguably (/easily) the most anticipated British album this year, it’s been several years in the making, but judging from this lead single, definitely worth the wait. Heavier and grungier than anything they’ve done before, it’s made for blasting out from festival main stages – just wait until that last riff kicks in. Stick your headphones on, get out your best air guitar, and soak it up.",
