  "body": "The world of **[Jealov](http://www.facebook.com/Jealov)** has been a mysterious one since its very inception. The Belgium group of producers/film makers have been putting out short cryptic films in the lead up to their new EP, **_Translations_**. Now the EP has dropped, the level of obscurity seems apt. The record is hard to define, yet rather than being annoyingly unobtainable in terms of understanding; it plays with well-known and loved sounds and samples. The record, largely made up of well popular Rn’B and Hip-Hop samples, plays with these sounds and textures to great effect. It creates a cloud of mystery around records from the likes of **Justin Timberlake** and **Beyonce**, jolting them into a new dimension entirely.\n\nSteam the record, which is out now on **[Mush Records](http://www.facebook.com/MushRecords)**, below.\n\n[Jealov – Teasing ‘Translations’ 2](http://vimeo.com/19586649) from [jealov](http://vimeo.com/user5202387) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
