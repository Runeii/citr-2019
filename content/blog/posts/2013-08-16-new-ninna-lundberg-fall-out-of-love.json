  "title": "New: Ninna Lundberg – Fall Out Of Love",
  "date": "2013-08-16T15:00:31",
  "body": "In an age when marketing your music as ‘folk’ is seemingly the hip thing to do (here’s looking at you Mumford, Marling, Rose etc.\n\n), it’s pretty difficult to discern what’s genuine and what is folk for folk’s sake. Denmark’s **Ninna Lundberg** new (possibly debut) track _Fall Out Of Love_ is a beautiful merging of folk and lo-fi influences, all centred around her rather fantastic vocal. So the production values are far from that of a chart hit, but that’s part of what makes it so endearing. Whereas the aforementioned faux-folk artists retreat into multi-million pound recording studios, **Lundberg** sounds like she’s recording in a basement or a bedroom. Check out _Fall Out Of Love_ below.",
