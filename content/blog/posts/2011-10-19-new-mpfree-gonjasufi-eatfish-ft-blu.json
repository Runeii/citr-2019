  "body": "It’s been a long time coming, but we finally have new material from psychedelia infused artist **Gonjasufi**.\n\nHis new track, produced by **Johnson&Jonson** and featuring MC **Blu**, is just as heady yet fragile as the highlights from his debut LP, [**_A Sufi and A Killer_**.](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/216-gonjasufi-a-sufi-and-a-killer/ \"Review: Gonjasufi\") Yet it’s still a brave new direction, the beats are heavier and with this track Sufi perhaps goes down the focused ‘hip-hop’ route more than ever. It’s also more socially conscious, at least in a more literal sense, with Gonjasufi calling for us to “Be rich east fish and die”.\n\nThe track is taken from his imminent free EP due out on October 24th via [Hydroshare](http://hydroshare.tv/)\n\nStream and download the track below.",
