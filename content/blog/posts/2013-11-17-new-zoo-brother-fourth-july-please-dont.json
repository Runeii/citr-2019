  "title": "New: Zoo Brother – Fourth of July / Please Don't",
  "date": "2013-11-17T14:51:08",
  "body": "William Karmis aka Chicago’s **Zoo Brother** conjures up the sort of dreamy riffs that Wild Nothing and The Drums would be insanely jealous of.\n\nHis new single, _Fourth of July_, is a myriad of reverb soaked vocals and gallant wails and shrieks, perhaps openly influenced more by the likes of Animal Collective, than the aforementioned artists. Fourth of July comes with the equally as addictive b-side, _Please Don’t_, centred around yet another killer hook. Check out both tracks below, as well as the fantastic artwork above.",
