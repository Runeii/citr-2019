  "body": "Artwork by [Katarina Soskic](../music/9346-new-grandpa-was-a-lion-dancerflying-birds/www.katarinasoskic.net)\n\nOver the last 6 days or so, **[Grandpa Was a Lion](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Grandpa-Was-A-Lion/149221175111693)** have been slowly dropping unheard demos of early material. The same beautifully withered vocals are present as ever, with each phrase sounding like a last gasp of hope or devotion. The weak and torn guitar notes elevate the music even further, perfectly mirroring the brokenly soulful tones of the vocals. Out of the 7 cuts dropped, we’ve established 2 highlights, _**Paris**_ and **_Post-Acid_**, that are worthy as a starting point.\n\nSo sit back, grab some tissues and prepare to be transported. Then when you’re finished, why not head over to their **[bandcamp](http://grandpawasalion.bandcamp.com)** to stream the other 5 tracks?",
