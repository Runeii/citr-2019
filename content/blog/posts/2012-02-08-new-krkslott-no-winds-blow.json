  "body": "Sometimes the simplest track can ultimately prove to be the most moving, a fact that I’m sure Sweden’s **Krkslott** would testify to.\n\nThe solo project of Amanda Randau from folk outfit **Collections of Swanvapor**, **Krskslott’s** debut track _No Winds Blow_ is comprised entirely of her stunning vocals and a gently strummed acoustic guitar. Utilizing the layered, echoed vocals to fantastic effect, _No Winds Blow_ is a stirring, six minute journey, simultaneously heartwarming and devastating. Stream _No Winds Blow_ below.\n\n<a href=\"http://krkslott.bandcamp.com/track/no-winds-blow\">No winds blow by Krkslott</a>",
