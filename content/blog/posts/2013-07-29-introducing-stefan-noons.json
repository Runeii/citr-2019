Don’t argue).\n\nBut it’s his vocals that really grab your attention, hinting towards a younger, less-tormented **Jamie Stewart**; a comparison even more audible on follow up track _Signals._\n\nThis is carefully constructed, recorded and produced music that you need to hear.\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/87914684″ params=”” width=” 100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/102433866″ params=”” width=” 100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]",
