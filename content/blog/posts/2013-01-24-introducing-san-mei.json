  "body": "There’s certainly something in the Australian water that’s lending itself to such fantastic electronic music at the moment.\n\nGold Coast singer **San Mei** has just unveiled her two debut tracks, _Watch The Breezes_ and _Already Know_, both expertly produced numbers; dreamy yet refined. With 2013 rapidly shaping up to be the year of females with synths, **San Mei** adds her name to an ever-growing list of artists to keep an eye out for over the coming months. Combining the song-writing finesse of **Lana Del Rey** with an almost classical style vocal, she’s a girl with an extremely bright future ahead of her. Check out both tracks below, and grab a free download while you can.",
