  "body": "Nearly two years on from making their debut on [these very pages](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/12867-introducing-blaenavon/), teenage wunderkids **Blaenavon** are set to release their hotly anticipated debut EP, entitled KOSO (after their managers nickname). Whilst they’re beginning to shake the ‘bedroom recordings’ feel to their output, there’s still an immediate intimacy to their music that’s strangely refreshing. EP opener _Gods_ is a reworked version of an old demo, now bolder and ready for the live circuit, whereas blog favourites _Wunderkind_ and _Prague_ have received comparisons to everyone from Wild Beasts, to The Maccabees to Coldplay (…?). Stream the full EP below, and pick up a copy from [Transgressive](http://transgressiverecords.com/release/kosoep).",
