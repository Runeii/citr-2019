  "date": "2012-02-03T20:31:05",
  "body": "Having wowed fans all across the UK in 2011 with their unique brand of no-frills-attached indie pop gems, North East quintet [**Vinyl Jacket**](http://facebook.com/vinyljacket) return with new single _Red Light_. As always, the new track comes accompanied by a fantastically original, quirky video, complete with luminous facepaints, a plethora of dancers and even the lads themselves throwing some shapes. Premiered by Huw Stephens and Greg James earlier last month, _Red Light_ is a near perfect slice of indie pop heaven; worthy of gracing dancefloors throughout the country.\n\nRed Light is released 5 March through [The Calico Print](http://thecalicoprint.bandcamp.com/album/red-light).",
