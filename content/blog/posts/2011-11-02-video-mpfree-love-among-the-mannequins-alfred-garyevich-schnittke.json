  "date": "2011-11-02T22:25:01",
  "body": "You gotta love those hardworking chaps at [Function Records](http://www.functionrecords.com/ \"Shove a tongue for Anakin \"). They’ve already released material from the wondrously various likes of Juffage, ✝Hymns✝ and Shield Your Eyes this year, but far from resting on their laurels, they’re throwing more and more of the good stuff at us. Working up to the release of debut full-length **_Radial Images_** on Function, Brighton-based **Love Among The Mannequins** (featuring them out of [O You Broken Eyes](https://www.facebook.com/oyoubrokeneyes \"Go To Smoking Lines\"), [Shoes and Socks Off](http://shoesandsocksoff.tumblr.com/ \"Cooze and Scrot Rot\") and [Crooked Mountain Crooked Sea](http://crookedmountaincrookedsea.bandcamp.com/ \"Look at pouting, look at me\")) have created the archive footage-based video for _Alfred Garyevich Schnittke_, as well as putting the song up for download.\n\nAs is probably par for the course for a band named after a line penned by J.G. Ballard, _Schnittke_ manages to cram an impressive amount of references to the cultural greats of the last few centuries into its three and a quarter minutes. It can be snooty, silly, or ferociously forward-thinking, depending on which way you look at it, but whatever you decide, _Alfred Garyevich Schnittke_ is a whole heckload of juddering, distorted, Pavement-flavoured fun. Can you think of another guitar band who can make the words ‘_Beethoven’s Burton’s line’_ sound so motherfuckin’ catchy? Nah. Didn’t think so.\n\n_**Radial Images**_ is out Monday 17th November on Function Records. To download _Alfred Garyevich Schnittke_ head over to the Function [bandcamp](http://functionrecords.bandcamp.com/track/alfred-garyevich-schnittke \"Guv's a young Mark Lanegan\"). You can keep track of Love Among via their [Tumblr](http://loveamongthemannequins.tumblr.com/ \"Doves have sprung for tans again. \").",
