  "body": "One listen to _Paris 12_, the latest release from Singapore’s **Linying**, and it’s easy to see why tastemakers are tripping over themselves to praise her intimate, emotionally fragmented songwriting.\n\nWith two previous tracks, _Sticky Leaves_ and _Alpine_, both racking up over a million plays on Spotify a piece, there’s an endearingly simplicity to her sound, that allows her elegant vocal and reassuring songwriting to truly soar. This is breathtaking stuff. Check out _Paris 12_ and _Sticky Leaves_ below.\n\nLike this?
