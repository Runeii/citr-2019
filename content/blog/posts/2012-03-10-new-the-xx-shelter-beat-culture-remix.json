  "body": "You don’t need me to tell you again just how talented this kid is.\n\nHis sophomore record _**Tokyo Dreamer**_ has been a regular player since it dropped earlier this year, and this brilliant new remix of **The XX** is destined for similar. Transforming the ethereal atmosphere of the original into a more upbeat, almost trance inspired tune far more suited for sweaty dancefloors; **Beat Culture** centers much of this remix around the killer hook and spotless vocals, adding his own interpretations either side. If this isn’t the sound of summer approaching, then shit, I don’t know what is.",
