  "date": "2012-02-13T19:39:17",
  "body": "Having impressed last year with a fantastic string of remixes, **S.**\n\n**Maharba** is back, this time toying with a track from one of the albums of the year so far. Adding his stereotypically expansive sound and synth inspired drawl, **S.Maharba** leaves the vocals relatively intact, yet thrashes the rest of the track into a gloriously, almost unrecognizable mess. With more original material on the way, 2012 is shaping up rather nicely for the producer.\n\nCheck out **S.Maharba’s** _Night In The Ocean (S.Maharba Serpent Love Song Remix)_ below, and grab a listen of **Young Magic’s** debut album **_Melt_** which comes out tomorrow.",
