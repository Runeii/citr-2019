When I say ‘a lot’, I’m not quite sure you know how many I mean. Head over to his [Bandcamp](http://gloof.bandcamp.com/) for a scan, there’s a lot to get lost in. His new piece of work _togethrniss\\_∆\\_side_ is a lo-fi analogue filtered dream world to end the year in, or indeed the world. The samples are few and far between, instead layered sounds and synths are looped for an at times aggravating experience. Aggravating in a good way I might add, always in a good way.",
