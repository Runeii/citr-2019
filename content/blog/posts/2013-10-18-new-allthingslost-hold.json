  "body": "I’ve just spent the last three or four hours checking out a bunch of new music from Australia, and it’s far to say that it’s easily the most exciting place for new music in the world right now.\n\nBrisbane’s **Allthingslost** aka eighteen year old **Abraham Tilbury** is one of the many talents in a blossoming electronic scene, with new track _Hold You Down_ showcasing a glimpse of his musical maturity. With touches of SOHN and James Blake, yet with elements of folk hidden amidst the songwriting, _Hold You Down_ is an absolute gem, and hopefully the sign of even better to come.\n\n_Our hands are intertwined, the tears are almost broken,_  \n_The last words almost spoken._",
