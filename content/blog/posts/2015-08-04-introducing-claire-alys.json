  "body": "Getting some real old school R&B vibes from LA’s **Claire Alys**.\n\nWith only a Jessie Ware cover, and her debut single, _The Last Time_, to her name, it’s clearly early days, but there’s definite potential. Mixing a bluesy guitar line with a straight up 90’s inspired pop hook, it’s a unique combination, and hopefully an indication of more to come. Check it out below.\n\nFollow our [Spotify On Repeat playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a hand-picked selection of the current hottest tracks.",
