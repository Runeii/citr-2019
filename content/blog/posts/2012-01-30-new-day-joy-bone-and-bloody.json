  "date": "2012-01-30T18:12:27",
  "body": "Having released their debut digital single at the tail end of last year, dream-pop duo **Day Joy** are back with new song _Bone And Bloody_.\n\nLess electronic in sound, and pulling heavily on their folk influences, it’s lead by a tinkling banjo and deep, ever-so tender vocals. Almost like a less stadium refined **Fleet Foxes**, the addition of backing vocals work brilliantly, with the tracks most telling lyric coming towards the end “_I can barely find a place where you won’t leave me in the gutter,_ _where you won’t leave me bone and bloody”_. Check out _Bone And Bloody_ below.\n\nvia [Earmilk](http://www.earmilk.com/2012/01/26/day-joy-bone-and-bloody-earmilk-premiere/)",
