  "body": "After months of planning, nervous breakdowns and late night meetings, **Crack in the Road** is pleased to announce a collaboration with **[Brainchild Festival](http://www.brainchildfestival.co.uk/)**. If you’ve followed the blog for a while now, you’ll know we don’t plunge into things like this lightly, the last one being a charity record with [Youth Music](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/7835-citr-and-youth-music-present/ \"CitR and Youth Music Present…\"), a worthy cause I’m sure you’ll agree.\n\nBut [Brainchild](https://www.facebook.com/BrainchildFestival) is different, and more importantly she wears her differences on her sleeve. Taking place from the 29th of June to the 1st of July, the festival is a celebration of thinking, originality and personal belief. Sounds pretty vague and wet right? Let me explain.\n\nTake any preconceptions you had about modern festivals and politely tell them to evacuate. Now imagine a festival without a backstage or VIP area, imagine camping next to the headliners, imagine beers that aren’t £5 a pop, imagine a round the clock cinema sponsored by the **BFI**, imagine poetry, comedy, political talks; imagine a celebration of ideas, imagine a celebration of self.\n\nNow imagine it with 500 other like-minded people in a field in Easthampstead, (just outside of Reading), and you’re pretty close.\n\nWe couldn’t be more excited about this and as a follower of this blog we’re pretty sure you will be too. Below is the first wave of acts, with the headliners set to be announced this Friday. Trust us when we say this; you’re going to be very fucking excited.\n\nThe capacity is set strictly at 500, grab your tickets [HERE](http://brainchildfestival.bigcartel.com/), and do it soon to avoid disappointment.\n\n**[Jamie Isaac](http://jamieisaac.bandcamp.com/ \"Jamie Isaac\")**\n\n**[Blaenavon](http://soundcloud.com/blaenavon \"Blaenavon\")**\n\n** [Pandr Eyez](http://soundcloud.com/pandreyez \"Pandr Eyez\")**\n\n**[Death Rattle](http://deathrattle.bandcamp.com/track/the-dig \"Death Rattle\") **\n\n**[Phosphor](http://phosphor.bandcamp.com/album/to-never-love-again \"Phosphor\")**\n\n**[Waskerley Way](http://waskerleyway.bandcamp.com/track/storm-song \"Waskerly Way\")**\n\n**[Cholombian](http://soundcloud.com/cholombian \"Cholombian\")**\n\n**[Palmistry](http://soundcloud.com/palmistry \"Palmistry\")**\n\n**[ATLAS](http://atlasband.bandcamp.com/track/lullaby \"ALTAS\")**\n\n**[Blood Sport](http://bloodsport.bandcamp.com/)**\n\n**[Nomad Soul](http://soundcloud.com/nomad-soul-collective \"Nomad Soul\") **\n\nCheck the whole line-up **[HERE](http://www.brainchildfestival.co.uk/lineup.html)**, buy tickets **[HERE](http://brainchildfestival.bigcartel.com/)**, and check back this friday for some more exciting announcements!",
