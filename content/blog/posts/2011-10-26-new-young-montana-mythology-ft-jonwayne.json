  "body": "What’s this? **Jonwayne** doing vocals on somebody else’s production? And not rapping about Super Mario?\n\n**Young Montana?** is the culprit here.\n\nThe young Coventry composer has been dabbling in this-and-that since releasing his debut, _**Limerence**_, earlier this year. And **Jonwayne** has only just released a new EP – on the same label, **Alpha Pup Records** – called _**The Death Of Andrew**_. I haven’t heard all of that yet, but I have heard this new one recently upped on SoundCloud.\n\nOnce again utilising 80’s pop samples as the basic frame, it’s indisputably **Montana?**, and **Jonwayne**‘s fat white boy blabbering doesn’t give up, in an **Aesop Rock** kind of way. The vocoded monologue creeps its way into obscurity towards the end, and by that time the track warps about and ends abruptly. Tight.\n\n_Listen to Mythology below._",
