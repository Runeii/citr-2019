  "date": "2012-02-01T23:26:44",
  "body": "Hailing from Budapest, folk-pop outfit **Golden Sundays** have an element to their debut track that, as my younger brother put it, ‘Gary Barlow would be proud of’.\n\n_All Because Of Me_ is a fantastic indie-pop number, not breaking any boundaries, but thoroughly enjoyable. From the lightly strummed guitar, to the honey-sweet lyrics (_‘I no longer I feel I have to live like someone else, in your arms tonight everything seems right’_), all centered around the insanely catchy chorus, it’s a debut track well worthy of praise. Check out _All Because Of Me_ below.\n\n<a href=\"http://goldensundays.bandcamp.com/track/all-because-of-me\">All Because Of Me by Golden Sundays</a>",
