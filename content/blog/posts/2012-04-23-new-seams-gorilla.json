Having appeared on BBC R1 last night to perform several tracks during [Ally McCrae’s show](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00rd4wh), the Scottish outfit have released a new track _Gorilla_ as a free download. With Katie’s sublime vocal and the jerky **Foals**\\-esque guitar lines, **Seams** have one of the finest sounds around, striving to embodying a sort of energy that’s vaguely reminiscent of **Blood Red Shoes**. Check out _Gorilla_ below.",
