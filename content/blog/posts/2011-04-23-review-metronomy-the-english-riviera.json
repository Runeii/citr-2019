English dance pop group Metronomy also reference the county and town that band leader Joe Mount grew up in with their exotically titled third album “The English Riviera”.\n\nThe coastal town of Torbay in Devon may not have the glamour and style of the millionaires playboy paradise of the French Riviera yet Metronomy have created a whole fantasy world to escape to as their own eccentric English paradise. Opening track “We Broke Free” sees Mount imploring someone to take a trip round his own personal dream world.\n\n“So get yourself fixed up  \nI’ll take you round town  \nI swear you’ll never witness anything quite as fine  \nThank God the gold is mine”\n\nMusically the album is a treasure trove of subtle pleasures and understated hooks bursting with imagination. In direct contrast to the indie disco thrills of previous album “Nights Out” Mount has re-rooted the group into a self assured art pop group. This is emphasised by the addition of new members; bassist Gbenga Adelakan and drummer and vocalist Anna Prior. While the new line up only actually appear on the record on one track, the beguiling, charming “Corrine” which sounds like an electro pop version of Fleetwood Mac, it is clear that this records more organic refined musical style has precipitated the change to a more musically dexterous line up.\n\nOne thing that immediately strikes you when listening to this record is how wonderfully coherent it is and how it flows so well. Nothing ever seems forced or out of place. The record effortlessly flows from the low slung loping funk of “She Wants” to the quirky electro sounds of “Some Written” and the exuberant bright pop of “The Bay” which tells of the magical “Endless beaches, that flow on and on” referring back to the albums title.\n\nMention must also be made of album highlight “Everything Goes My Way” a duet between Mount and Veronica Falls singer Roxanne Clifford. A simple rolling melody carries a gloriously sweet love song, both voices mixing to melodic perfection. It’s eminently charming and loveable.\n\n“It feels so good to have you back my love  \nI’m in love again”\n\nSome older fans of Metronomy may feel disappointed when hearing this record, that the dance floor sounds and disco dynamics of “Nights Out” have been eschewed, but over time they will be placated by the fact that Metronomy have made the album of their career. Big, dumb obvious dance floor electro is all well and good but that would have been the easy option for Joe Mount to go down. This is a clear progression and a perfect example of cerebral art pop which establishes Joe Mounts position as one of the UK’s brightest musical talents. Mercury prize judges take note.",
