Here I upload stuff I’ve written that I do not really know what to make of.’ Quite a fitting description for a collection of tracks that don’t really fit anywhere within the realms of normality, yet are all the more enchanting for it.\n\n**refinnej** (Jennifer backwards, see, I could work that much out!) has little online presence, aside from a Bandcamp with half a dozen ambient recordings on, accompanied by over-exposed photographs. Mixing her own vocals with swirling dronescapes, refinnej’s compositions are ambitious and luxuriously refined. Check out a couple of her Grouper-esque pieces below.",
