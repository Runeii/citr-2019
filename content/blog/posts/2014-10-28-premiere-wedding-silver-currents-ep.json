  "body": "Sometimes an artists sound really hits home.\n\nSan Francisco’s Lauren Grubb a.k.a **To The Wedding** is one such artist, with every song she has released so far completely blowing me away. Her debut E.P _Silver Currents_, which we are delighted to premiere, brings together the dreamy shoegaze and all encapsulating sound that I’ve grown to love and presents it in the shape of five perfectly crafted tracks. From the drifting guitars of _Come On_ to the crushing _Set Fire_, this really is how a debut release should be done. _Time Pilot_ closes the E.P in spectacular fashion, floating through your head, bringing you back to earth after what really is a beautiful journey.\n\nStream the E.P below which is released 28 October.",
