As running jokes go, when and if the album will be dropped, is quickly becoming a quip that no longer remains funny. Couple that with the fact that this demo isn’t even complete, and you’ve got yourself one frustrated listener. Despite the frustration, the track is a real treat. The rhymes are thoughtful and introspective, the beats jazzy and organic, the overall package is too damn attractive to stay mad for too long.\n\nHit play and stay hopeful.",
