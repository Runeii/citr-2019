Before making the record Onra went to Vietnam, where his grandparents are from, and managed to bring back some 30 old Chinese and Vietnamese vinyl records. He then made a full album with this material; Chinoiseries, which is his most critically acclaimed album.\n\nThe highlight is perhaps “The Anthem”, a piece of music that was later chosen for a Coca-Cola commercial at the Beijing Olympics. The piece is short, sharp and utterly infectious, taking influences from jazz and swing it creates a truly absorbing wall of sound layered with the most intricate of samples. Three years later and the record is just as fresh as the day it was cut. Enjoy.",
