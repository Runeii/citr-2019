  "body": "Canadian rap duo Pigeon Hole are gearing up for the release of their new album _Chimp Blood_ and have recently dropped the opening track from the LP.\n\n‘Wolf Pack’ smoulders with brooding intent, rumbling bass rolling underneath percussive guitar and piano stabs.\n\nThe duo, hailing from Vancouver, growl and howl their way through the track with flows that are reminiscent of an on-form Cage. _Chimp Blood_ is being released through URBNET on the 5th March and can pre-ordered [here](http://urbnet.bandcamp.com/album/chimp-blood). You can stream ‘Wolf Pack’ below and, if the rest of the album consists of songs as good as this one, we’re all in for a treat when it drops.",
