  "body": "Milwaukee’s **The Delphines** are one of my favourite underground acts of the year; disastrously underrated, yet part of me quite enjoys having them as my own little secret.\n\nTheir new EP titled **_God Help The Delphines_** is ten minutes of whiskey soaked, weed-addled 60’s pop, following on from the release of their fantastic single Panic. Take the terrifyingly upbeat _’71_, that’s part **Beach Boys**, part **Best Coast** and 100% awesome. It’s not until the final track on the EP, the sombre _Half of a Century_, that they take their foot off the gas, slowing things down to a sultry, percussion heavy walk, whilst maintaing their rhythmic swagger. Check out the full EP now, and grab a pay-what-you-like download. Trust me, it’s worth it.",
