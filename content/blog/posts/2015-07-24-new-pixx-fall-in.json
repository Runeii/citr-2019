  "body": "Previously revealing her debut effort in the form of an enigmatic video, 4AD newcomer Pixx, real name Hannah Rodgers, has now made the track available to stream on SoundCloud.\n\nEmbedded below, ‘Fall In’ is a beautifully striking entry into the world as it channels sounds of label mates Cocteau Twins and echoes a similar energy to that of Grimes.\n\nUtterly absorbing in it’s soundscape, ‘Fall In’ threads the listener through a journey that gravitates between swirling space, occupied primarily by Rodgers’ warm, hypnotising vocals, before emerging into an all encompassing choral piece of brilliance. ‘Fall In’ feels very much like just the beginning for this very promising 19 year old.\n\n‘Fall In’ is taken from Pixx’s debut EP of the same name, released on August 28th.",
