The influence of a certain reviled type of dance music are obvious: if the duo cranked up the bass during the chorus and emphasised the saw sounds, you could probably soundtrack a shitty Internet Explorer advert.\n\nIt’s a good job then that they didn’t, instead crafting two slices of top quality synth-pop. Fans of **FOE** and Bell’s old collaborators **Chairlift **will dig this to no end. \n\nHopefully we’ll be seeing a lot more of them in the near future, but for now you can pick up the tracks on vinyl/download via Moshi Moshi, or stream _Oyster _and personal preference _Know Yourself _below.\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/94791825″ params=”secret\\_token=s-u7U7O” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/102391652″ width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]",
