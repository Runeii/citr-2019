  "date": "2013-11-20T00:31:40",
  "body": "Having drummed up a fair few plays on a [rough demo](https://soundcloud.com/sophie-wilkie/far-west) of this track a month or so ago, **Ocean Calling** aka Bellingham’s **Sophie Wilkie** has released the full version of _Far West_, and it doesn’t disappoint. Breathy M83 style vocals, and **CHVRCHES**\\-esque synth sections building to an epic, dream-your-heart-out crescendo; from Wilkie’s Facebook posts, there’s an underlying feeling that she perhaps doesn’t appreciate simply how good this track is. Whilst it may only be a first step forward, and an at times hesitant one at that, there’s more than enough here to suggest that Ocean Calling is a name well worth keeping an eye out for in 2014. Check out Far West below, and grab a download from her [Bandcamp](http://oceancalling.bandcamp.com/).",
