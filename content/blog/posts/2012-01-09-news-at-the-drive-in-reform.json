  "body": "After murmurings for a number of months now, it appears that Texas rock group **At The Drive-In** have finally broken their silence and announced their reformation as a band.\n\nIn a message on what claims to be the bands [official twitter](https://twitter.com/#%21/AtTheDriveIn_), they state: ‘¡ ATTENTION ! To whom it may concern: AT THE DRIVE-IN will be breaking their 11 year silence THIS STATION IS …NOW…OPERATIONAL’ A similar message is also repeated on their [official website](http://atdimusic.com/).\n\nI’d imagine that a host of festival appearances will be on the cards, including Leeds/Reading and Coachella, and I’m sure that the five piece will no doubt be welcomed back with open arms.\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-shot-2012-01-09-at-18.53.51-640x303.png \"At The Drive-In Statement\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13599-news-at-the-drive-in-reform/attachment/screen-shot-2012-01-09-at-18-53-51/)",
