  "body": "NY’s **Mïrändä** makes quite the impression with her debut EP, **_Empire_**, released at the end of last week.\n\nPlaying with elements of dream-pop merged with more intense, almost trance leaning moments, it’s a delicately atmospheric and blossoming listen. Opener, _Memoria_ feels like it should be lifted straight from a retrospectively slightly cheesy 80’s cult film, whilst EP centre piece, _Cruel 2 B Kind_ is blistering energetic and unrelenting – part Depeche Mode, part Grimes. Check out a couple of EP highlights below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
