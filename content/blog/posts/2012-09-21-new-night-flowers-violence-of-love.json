  "date": "2012-09-21T23:57:30",
  "body": "Written specially for Ryan Haysom’s short film ‘Yellow’, _Violence (Of Love)_ is the first we’ve heard from London’s **Night Flowers** since their fantastic [debut EP](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/15603-introducing-night-flowers/) back in March. Featuring Panda Stewart on vocals, it’s fairly different from the shoegaze sound of their previous release, and falls more inside the dream-pop boundaries, drawing from **Cocteau Twins** and **Keep Shelly In Athens**. Whilst I’m yet to see the film (I’ve heard it’s brilliant), I’m sure that this song is a more than fitting soundtrack. Check it out below, and grab a free download while you can.",
