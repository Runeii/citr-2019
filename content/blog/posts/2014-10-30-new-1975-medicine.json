  "body": "Over a year since we heard any new material from The 1975, but what a twelve months it has been.\n\nFrom selling out huge shows all over the world, to seeing their debut album cemented well within the top50, week after week; there’s few British bands who can claim to have had a bigger 2014 than the Manchester quartet.\n\nReturning briefly with their contribution to BBC Radio 1’s re-score of Drive (which airs tonight on BBC3 at 10pm, also featuring Bastille, CHVRCHES and BANKS amongst others), Medicine sees them channeling a newer, more ambient sound; one that they’ve experimented with briefly in the past on early EPs. A love song at heart, and a love song with heart, it’s a fitting tribute to Nicolas Winding Refn’s portrayal of romance.",
