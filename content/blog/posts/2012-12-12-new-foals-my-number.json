  "body": "With the [cryptic Foals website](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/18200-news-foals-unveil-cryptic-website/) generating a fair amount of hype at the beginning of November, the release of [Inhaler](www.crackintheroad.com/music/18264-video-foals-inhaler/), the first single to be taken from their next album, was somewhat subdued in comparison. However newest track _My Number_ is likely to add to anticipation building over the release of _**Holy Fire**_, their third album, which is out later next year. A return to the jagged, colourful guitars of **_Antidotes_** and off-beat percussion, it’s fairly standard Foals, but hey, if it’s not broken, why try to fix it? Check out My Number below, thanks to [Disco Naiveté](disconaivete.com) for the heads up.",
