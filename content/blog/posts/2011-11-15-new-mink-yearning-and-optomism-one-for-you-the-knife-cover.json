  "body": "First off, yes, I do realise that ‘optimism’ is spelled incorrectly, but frankly who cares whether it’s intentional or not, as the music more than makes up for any grammatical issues.\n\nThese two debut tracks from Seattle electronic artist [Mink](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Mink/139004432869423?sk=wall) are six and a half minutes of ambient, trance inducing beauty. Opening with a cover of **The Knife’s** psychedelic track _One For You_, and morphing it into a gorgeously minimal vocal driven gem, it’s clear from the off that **Mink** has talent.\n\nSecond track _Yearning and Optomism_ is less atmospheric, and follows a fairly standard electronic structure, but pulls if off elegantly, with the swirling layered vocals proving a particular highlight. As with much of the new music on _**CitR**_, I’m yet to find out too much about this Seattle artist, but I’m extremely excited to hear more from her.",
