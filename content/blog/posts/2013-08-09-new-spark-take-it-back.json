Jess Morgan, a twenty one year old from Walthamstow, feels like she should be guesting on a Nelly track, with her super slick delivery, girl power agenda and uber soulful vocals. Ten years ago, this would have been straight onto the Radio I A list, that’s not to say it’s any less enjoyable now. Check out _Take It Back_ below, alongside previous single _Struck Out_.",
