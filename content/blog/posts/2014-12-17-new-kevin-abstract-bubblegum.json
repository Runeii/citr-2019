  "body": "PC Music haven’t got a rapper on their books yet, at least not as we much as we’ve seen so far, and based upon the sound of new track, Bubblegum, Texan rapper **Kevin Abstract** would fit in pretty nicely.\n\nAs with the rest of the output on his Soundcloud, it’s pushing boundaries and current understandings of modern rap music, with the closest possible comparison being the outcome of SOPHIE producing for Kendrick Lamar. Check out Bubblegum below, or head over to [his website](http://kevinabstract.com/) to view it in full visual glory.",
