  "body": "Finally, a version of _Same Love_ / _She Keeps Me Warm_ without the irritating drawl of [Macklemore](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlVBg7_08n0) (I jest, I jest, sort of), I mean, ‘_When I was in third grade / I thought that I was gay / ‘cus I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight_‘, come on….\n\nIn a year when same sex marriage has been such a hotly debated topic, it’s fitting that such a beautifully poignant song should rise above all the political bullshit and outdated religious untruths, reminding us once again, that love is love, and nobody can deny you that. Check out **Mary Lambert’s** solo version of _She Keeps Me Warm_ below.",
