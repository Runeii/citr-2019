New single After The Moment is no exception, being inexplicably simple but effective, allowing the vocals to lull the listener into a hypnotic trance. At heart it’s a love song, yet it provides much more, danceable and energetic, it’s blissful melody is a joy to behold. B-Side Love Well Spent continues in a similar vein, repetitive synths and combined female (courtesy of Emily Reo) and male vocals add an extra dimension to the track.\n\n [Craft Spells :: After the Moment](http://soundcloud.com/beachtapes/craft-spells-after-the-moment) by [Beachtapes](http://soundcloud.com/beachtapes)",
