  "body": "I’m starting to feel like maybe there’s no point in anyone outside of Australia making music at this present moment in time.\n\nWith the sheer amount of brilliant music coming from down under, it’s far and away the most exciting ‘scene’ in the world right now.

It’s one of the most beautiful tracks of the year. Check out both tracks below.",
