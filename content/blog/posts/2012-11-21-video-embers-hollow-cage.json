  "body": "Mancunian quartet **Embers** do epic better than any other new band around at the moment.\n\nThis grandiose live take of _Hollow Cage_ is far from **U2** stadium-rock epic; more **Sigur Ros**, tender, crescendoing atmospheric beauty, building into an anthem of phenomenal proportions. Flourishing string sections and rousing swathes of reverb soaked guitars meld seamlessly into one, with the iconic backdrop of Manchester’s Gorton Monastery proving the perfect setting for **Embers**enticingly brooding sound. It’s considered, it’s cinematic, and above all, it’s bloody brilliant.\n\n[Embers – Hollow Cage](http://vimeo.com/52973072) from [Embers](http://vimeo.com/embersembers) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
