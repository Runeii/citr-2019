  "body": "Berlin based “doom-folk” producer and singer songwriter Perera Elsewhere returns with her new single _Something’s Up._\n\nWith a similar mysterious soundscape to that of her debut album “Everlast”, Something’s Up has a beautiful combination of both space and depth. Bellowing drums and shimmering cymbals support the woozy synths and Perera’s smokey layered vocals in what is an almost hypnotic 3 minute experience. Check out her entrancing single in the link below.",
