  "body": "The kids at **CITR** were pretty big fans of the last **[Coma Cinema](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/5431-review-coma-cinema-blue-suicide/ \"Review: Coma Cinema – Blue Suicide\")** record, **_Blue Suicide_**, when it dropped earlier this year. Its gentle and morbid fascination with death and sorrow was downtrodden, yet oddly uplifting when in the hands of the band. The video that followed the release of the album continued the themes of the record almost perfectly, and was made by **Tyler T Williams**; a friend of the site no less.\n\nSo despite the dust now settled on the LP’s release, the punishingly unsettled atmosphere still manages to punctuate the mind. The new video for the single, **_Business as Usual_**, has a lot to do with this. Put together by filmmaker **[Micah Van Hove](http://vimeo.com/umuima)**, the video follows several figures as they deal with sorrow and loss in the only ways they know how. At times it’s blissfully frank, at others painfully harrowing, but always thoroughly absorbing.\n\n[Coma Cinema – Business as Usual](http://vimeo.com/27733623) from [Micah Van Hove](http://vimeo.com/umuima) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
