  "body": "We were teased the prospect of a new track by **SOHN** earlier this week and the bro wasn’t lying, after a couple of fairly high-profile remixes we finally have new material in the form of Bloodflows.\n\n**SOHN**’s voice has definitely come into its own, confident yet strained, he’s finally found a range that mirrors the production’s visceral clarity. In short, it’s his most assured and focused work to date, with the tracks structure at times flawless, the track’s ending builds to something utterly breathless, an adjective I hadn’t previously associated with **SOHN**’s work.\n\nHit play and check **SOHN**’s upcoming live dates below: oh shit, **Crack in the Road** are putting him on at their SXSW showcase??!! Man, those kidz r c00l.\n\n**[RSVP HERE.](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/5703238540?ref=ebtn#)**\n\n_March__  \n**_13/03 – BD Rileys – Crack In The Road/Disco Naivete – Austin SXSW_**  \n_13/03 – Red 7 – Windish Agency Showcase – Austin SXSW_  \n_14/03 – Hype Hotel – I Guess I’m Floating – Austin SXSW_  \n_15/03 – Mohawk – Windish Agency Day Party – Austin SXSW_  \n_16/03 – Latitude 30 – British Music Embassy – Austin SXSW__\n\n_April  \n06/04 – Motel Mozaique Festival – Rotterdam, Netherlands  \n12/04 – Sound Frame Festival – Vienna, Austraia  \n13/04 – Prince Charles – Berlin, Germany_\n\n_May  \n18/05 – Food For Your Senses Festival – Tuntage, Luxembourg  \n25/05 – London Calling – Amsterdam, Netherlands_\n\n_July  \n03/07 – Poolbar Festival – Feldkirch, Austraia  \n04/07 – Days Off Festival – Paris, France  \n19-21 – Longtitude Festival – Dublin, Ireland_\n\n_August__  \n_10/08 – Oya Festival – Oslo, Norway__",
