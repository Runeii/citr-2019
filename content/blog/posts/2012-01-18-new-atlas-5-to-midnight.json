  "body": "Having posted **ATLAS’s** debut track [_You_](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14223-atlas-you-14223/) yesterday, I checked back on [bandcamp](http://atlasband.bandcamp.com/track/5-to-midnight) earlier today and found it had been updated, including a link to their [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Atlas/292648584087496?sk=info) page. From there, you can find their [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/atlasmsc), which reveals **ATLAS** as the project of a certain **Sarah Hezen** from London. Anyway, enough detective work, new cut _5 To Midnight_ is a slightly less refined affair, seemingly rougher round the edges. There’s the delicate female vocals and dubstep inspired beats, rolling gloriously throughout the track in a menacing fashion yet it’s reassuringly realistic. Despite only having two tracks out so far, **ATLAS** is quickly becoming one of my favourite new artists, check out _5 To Midnight_ below.\n\n [5 to Midnight](http://soundcloud.com/atlasmsc/5-to-midnight) by [ATLAS Music](http://soundcloud.com/atlasmsc)",
