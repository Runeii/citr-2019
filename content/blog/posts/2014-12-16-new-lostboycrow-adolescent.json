  "body": "LA’s **LostBoyCrow** may well have just written one of the pop songs of the year, and given that we’re only two weeks from 2015, I can say that with an air of legitimacy.\n\nHis debut track, _Adolescent_ is brilliantly over the top synth-pop, part The Neighbourhood, part fellow LA outfit Pacific Air, all centred around a chorus of gargantuan proportions. Hinting at R&B influences, with the songwriting quality of The Killers of Passion Pit thrown in, it’s a real fist to the sky moment, a shining example of pop music done right. Check out Adolescent below, and keep up with **LostBoyCrow** over at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/lostboycrow/info?tab=page_info).",
