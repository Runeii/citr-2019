  "body": "Contrary to popular belief, capitalizing your band name does not make the music brash nor abrasive, in fact it’s pretty much the opposite with New York songstress **EDDI LINES**.\n\nA dwindling piano ballad, that’s as sleek and resplendent as possible without slipping to the overproduced Adele category, _GIGANTIC_ has all the makings of a ‘blog-hit’. Ending on the poignant line _‘I’ll crawl out of this hole, soon enough, take my ring off’_, it’s both devastating and enthralling all at once.\n\n<a href=\"http://eddilines.bandcamp.com/track/gigantic\">GIGANTIC by EDDI LINES</a>",
