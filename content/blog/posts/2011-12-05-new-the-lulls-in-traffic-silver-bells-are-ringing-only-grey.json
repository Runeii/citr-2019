  "body": "Call me Scrooge, but aside from a few choice exceptions, all Christmas songs are crap.\n\nAll the classics (_Fairytale of New York_, _The Snowman_) are played to death, and it goes without saying that the majority of modern festive tracks reek of tediously forced commercialization. However, every year there are always a handful of a tracks that choose to focus on the more spiritual elements of Christmas, such as tear-jerking memories and intimate relationships.\n\nThis new cut from Lakeland’s [**The Lulls In Traffic**](www.thelullsintraffic.com/) does entirely that, although you’d be forgiven for thinking otherwise when reading the lyrics to the first verse – _‘Well here comes my Santa on his way. I know that he has something beautiful for me somewhere on his sleigh. I was pretty good this year, at least I tried.’_ Yeah, I know what you’re thinking; ouch. Luckily, it doesn’t dwell on those issues for long, and instead morphs into a remorseful ballad, that anyone alone at this time of year can relate to. After the much improved chorus, a minimal, hip-hop beat kicks in, with the other half of **The Lulls In Traffic** taking over; not the slickest rap verse you’ll ever hear but it’s grounded in real life emotions, proving vitally important to the general feel of the track. Check out _Silver Bells Are Ringing Only Grey_ below, and download it if you fancy.",
