  "body": "Future buzzband **MVSCLES** set the internet alight just under a month ago with their debut track _Sweet n Sour_, an electro-pop diamond, sparkling with a confident swagger.\n\nWhat’s more impressive is that new jam _Where You Are_ is arguably even better, soaring vocals sections and a addictive sugary chorus, signalling the Boston duo out as one of 2012’s hottest properties. With a clear knack for penning infectious harmonies, you can guarantee this won’t be the last you hear from **MVSCLES**. Check out both tracks below and keep up with them via their [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/MVSCLES/322964224460980).",
