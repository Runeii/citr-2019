  "body": "Unlikely to appeal to all, **0.**\n\n**1’s** tracks available so far are complex, slightly bizarre compositions, but greatly intriguing. Never tying itself down to a particular genre, the highlight of his 25 cuts so far is _Softism,_ which furiously morphs between electronic and dub influences, to freak-folk inspirations, with the haunting vocals floating mystically over the top. The solo project of **Robert Streckfuss** from Australia, **0.1** embodies the true spirit of DIY dream-pop, quite hoe he’s gone relatively unnoticed for so long is completely beyond me. It’s tender and ferocious in equal measures, unsettling whilst beauteous, and above all, bloody brilliant. Check out _Softism_ below, and head over to his [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/0point1) for more.",
