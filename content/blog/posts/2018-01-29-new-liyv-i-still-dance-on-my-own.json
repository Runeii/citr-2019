  "date": "2018-01-29T14:40:20",
  "body": "**Liyv** has quickly become one of my favourite emerging artists of recent years.\n\nHer unique take on alt-pop feels simultaneously current and also forward thinking. With last year seeing the release of an EP that featured some of the finest pop song writing of 2017, her first single of 2018 is a markedly more experimental affair, yet no less captivating. Check out _I Still Dance On My Own_ below.",
