Having already featured several times on CitR, Tyler’s new video for Lance Smith’s Kathryn, My Love is another masterpiece. The song itself, which featured on the American version of teen drama Skins, is taken from Pandit’s debut LP Eternity Spin out on Waaga Records. The video is a trippy affair, distored lenses and large bear suits are the centre point of the work, expertly capturing the laid back, yet emotionally taught side to the track. Despite what may appear to be some depressing undertones, both in the track and the film, it’s essentially a celebration of youth and young, all consuming love. Stick your headphones on, go full screen, kick back and enjoy.",
