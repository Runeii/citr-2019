From battling with paralyzing drug addictions and a fourth album that came close to destroying all their hard work put in previously, they’ve had tough times. With third album _Because Of The Times_, the Tennessee rockers finally seemed to be fulfilling their rarely reached potential, an LP of storming tracks that translated perfectly into an electric and engrossing live performance. Yet _Only By The Night_ found the group in disarray, caught somewhere between impersonating _U2_ and attempting to fashion their own brand of emotional, singalong stadium pop. Albeit their most commercially successful album to date, lead by number one single _Sex On Fire_, their was a real feeling of disillusionment.\n\nSo it was tentatively that I gave **Kings Of Leon’s** new record, _Come Around Sundown_ a listen, would they produce a reinvigorated fifth record, or would they continue producing the sort of mundane sludge that shot them to such unrewarded dizzy heights? First single _Radioactive_ sees the foursome vying to return to 2007’s record, a vivacious guitar riff struts arrogantly through the entire track, backed by Caleb’s rasping vocals. Better than almost anything featured on the limp _Only By The Night_, the foursome have seemingly realized that they have never been, and never will be strong lyrically, and instead are playing to their strengths of writing relentless and appealing hooks.\n\n_Pyro_ finds Caleb in a dark, regretful place, lamenting “_everything I cherish is slowly dying or is gone_“, a far step from hearing him screech “_woaah your sex is on fire_” for the umpteenth time. Whilst it retains the anthemic feeling found on tracks like _Sex On Fire_ and _Use Somebody_, it’s much more exciting, yet still not a patch on their most accomplished single to date; _Fans_. Elsewhere, the almost unlistenable _Mary_ sounds like **Band Of Horses** dying a slow and painful death, sucked of all their emotional desire and aspirations.\n\nOnly four tracks in, and it’s the definition of a mixed bag, although there no moments that come close to touching their career defining album _Because Of The Times_, the truth is, they’ve done it before, and they’ve done it better. Elsewhere _The Immortals_ is an improvement, it’s the tracks with real drive and raw energy that allow the Kings to shine. Caleb’s intoxicated sounding voice which was always such a central core to the group, was far from utilized on _Only By The Night_, however with _Come Around Sundown_ they seem to have returned to playing to their strengths.\n\nUnfortunately for **Kings Of Leon**, they are never going to write and record another album that so perfectly captures the essence of the band and their live performances, as well as _Because Of The Times_ does. _Back Down South_ treads along woefully, sounding like Brandon Flowers at his utmost dry and desperate; **The Killers** at their worst, and everyone knows that not a compliment. Single in the making _Birthday_ is the closest the group come to sounding like their previous record, plodding along seemingly uninterested until the colossal chorus kicks in.\n\nCommercially I can’t see this, their fifth record, being anywhere near as successful as _Only By The Night_, the lack of Radio 1 friendly tracks and club songs see to that, yet the songwriting is far from exemplary. _Come Around Sundown_ has it’s moments, however if you want to appreciate **Kings Of Leon** at their sassiest, sexiest and crudest, then look elsewhere, as even the finer tracks on here feel like watered down versions of more superior songs from previous LPs. Maybe and hopefully, the commercial “failure” of this record might just be exactly what the Followill’s need to re-invigorate their disheartened and fatigued minds.",
