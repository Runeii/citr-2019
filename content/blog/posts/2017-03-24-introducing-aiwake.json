  "body": "With reworks of Abhi//Dijon and Basecamp under their belts already, it’s not too difficult to see the sort of territory that **aiwake** place themselves in.\n\nWhilst their debut track, _Birds_, is guilty of falling back a little heavily on worn out tropes, most notably in the EDM-lite production that creeps in, there’s still a sense that they’ve really got the potential to bring something fresh to the table. The first minute or so of the track is utterly captivating, merging elements of SOHN and James Blake, and hints at far more to come from aiwake, especially if they can carve out a niche entirely their own. Check out Birds below.",
