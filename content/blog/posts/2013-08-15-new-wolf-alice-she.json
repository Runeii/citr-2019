  "body": "With a host of Radio 1 featured singles under their belts, and majorly hyped slots at some of the UK’s biggest music festivals, **Wolf Alice** have the potential to lead that long awaited revival of British guitar music.\n\nWith a live performance that rivals that of any other new band, and an unparalleled energy to their music, it’s not too hard to see why they’re already one of the most hotly tipped acts for 2014. New single _She_, taken from their forthcoming debut EP Blush, is a real 90’s throwback, with shades of **Yeah Yeah Yeahs** and, dare I say **Rage Against The Machine** amidst the rumbling bassline and shrieking guitar riffs. Check it out below, and pre-order the EP from [Rough Trade](http://www.roughtrade.com/albums/75795).",
