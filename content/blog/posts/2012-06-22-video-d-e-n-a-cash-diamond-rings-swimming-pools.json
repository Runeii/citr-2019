  "date": "2012-06-22T16:39:13",
  "body": "Before anyone else points out the similarities, I’d like to state that I realise this new track from **D E N A** sounds an awful lot like **M.**\n\n**I.A.**, with it’s bratpack hip-hop vibe and unnervingly simplistic chorus. So it’s geekier, slightly forced and backed by the underlying feeling that it may not be entirely serious, yet somehow it sort of works in it’s own introvert way. The video is a twisted European insight into bling culture, with the paradox of middle class suburbia contrasted against the garish, abrasive image portrayed by **D E N A**. _Cash, Diamond Rings, Swimming Pools_ huh? If you say so. (Thanks to [DN](http://disconaivete.com/) for the tip)",
