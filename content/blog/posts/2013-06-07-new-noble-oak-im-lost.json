  "date": "2013-06-07T16:04:19",
  "body": "Someone give this kid a record deal already.\n\nQuite how Noble Oak has slipped right under the noses of label A&R’s is completely beyond me. With consistently fantastic output and a sound as unique as it is beautiful, it’s cliched to describe I’m Lost as otherworldly, but he genuinely transports the listener to another planet. Mixing his own elegantly sampled vocals, with his stereotypically intricate beats, this EP is shaping up to be rather special indeed.",
