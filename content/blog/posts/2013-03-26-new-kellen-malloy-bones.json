  "date": "2013-03-26T23:12:41",
  "body": "Having wowed with his duo of debut tracks, _Ocotillo_ parts I & II, LA’s **Kellen Malloy** dropped this stunning number while SXSW was in progress, hence the tardiness of the post.\n\nAtmospheric and brooding, _Bones_ is far downbeat and sombre in both tone and content, with the barely audible vocals burrowing through the layered guitar lines. There’s hints of Deptford Goth alongside more minimal mid-00’s dubstep in the production. Sleek, elegant and showcasing the immense diversity and talent that Malloy possesses. Check out Bones below.",
