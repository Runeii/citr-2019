  "body": "Perfect for the rare burst of warm weather we’ve experienced over the past few days, **The Babies** new single _Moonlight Mile_ may well prove to be one of the finest tracks of 2012.\n\nReviving the spirit of the early 70’s, it’s fast paced and exhilarating, cornered in with soaring riffs and absorbing, anthemic vocal sections. An indie hit if I ever heard one. Check out _Moonlight Mile_ below, released 14 August and pre-order it [here](http://www.insound.com/Moonlight-Mile-Vinyl-7inch-The-Babies/P/INS108677/) along with B-side _Places_. **The Babies** play a couple of shows later in the week, and are expected to release their new album **_Our House on the Hill_** later in the year.\n\n7/25 – Brooklyn, NY – Public Assembly (back room)  \n7/28 – Brooklyn, NY – Union Pool",
