  "body": "Since first hearing a couple of demos from DC duo **GEMS** toward the end of 2013, I’ve been eagerly awaiting their debut full length.\n\nHaving played CitR x Disco Naïveté SXSW shows in 2013 and then in 2014 alongside the likes of Hozier, Wolf Alice and The 1975, the duo are now clearly more than ready to make the step up to the big time. _Living as a Ghost_ is the first cut lifted from their debut album, Kill the One You Love, out 30 October on Carpark Records, and is another slice of otherworldly dream-pop. Combining the sort of guitar lines and sound that Ride or Jesus & Mary Chain would go crazy for, and the resplendent vocals of Lindsay Pitts, it’s a real statement, and hopefully an indication of the brilliance their debut album will hold. Check it out below.\n\nFollow our [Spotify On Repeat playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a hand-picked selection of the current hottest tracks.",
