His subtle manipulation of voices over textures that seem to gleam and sparkle is perhaps his greatest strength, but his treatment of the medium as a whole is perhaps what he will be known for. His latest release Skipping Puddles (complete with 2 remixes), clocks in at only 2.30, but is eloquent in its restraint. Abel treats the electronic music that he makes as an experience, an experience I’m looking forward to having more of.\n\n<a href=\"http://rebelmagazine.bandcamp.com/album/skipping-puddles\">Skipping Puddles by rebel</a>",
