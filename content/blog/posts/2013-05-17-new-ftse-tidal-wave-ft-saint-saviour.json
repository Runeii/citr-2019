There’s the glowing Rhodes that opens the song, the attention to drum sound, the man himself prefacing his gloomy, beaten tirade with a cheeky little stab at melisma. It’s a tactic he then reappropriates on keys for a banging middle eight, like someone’s trapped a choir of furies in a jam jar. There’s the surprise brass swells, and [Saint Saviour](http://saintsaviour.co.uk/ \"She's not named after Jesus. \")‘s star turns in the second verse and chorus (move over, ’cause she’s stealin’ the moment). _Tidal Wave_ smashes right into that maddening middle ground between hunger and restraint, and it’s gonna bust open whatever self-perpetuating pressure cabin you’ve trapped yourself in.\n\nThe _**FTSE I**_  EP, from which _Tidal Wave_ is lifted, is out July 1st on [Lucky Number](http://www.luckynumbermusic.com/ \"Look, there's his neck again. \").",
