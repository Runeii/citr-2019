  "body": "Pretty much a collaboration made in heaven, NY’s teenage rapper **Haleek Maul** teaming up with British producer **Forest Swords** is rather unexpected on paper, but in reality, works an absolute treat.\n\nI’ll be honest, I’m not as clued up on hip-hop hottest properties as I should be, but **Maul** has always caught my attention, with his gritty lyricism, and aggressive delivery. Check out new track _Lobo_ below.",
