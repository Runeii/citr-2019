  "body": "The videos coming from [**Blood Orange**’s](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/16215-video-blood-orange-champagne-coast/ \"Video: Blood Orange – Champagne Coast\") debut LP, **_Coastal Grooves_,** have actually been pretty exciting considering it was an album that failed to set my world alight. Maybe they’re slowly winning me over? The **Abteen Bagheri** directed video for ‘I’m sorry we lied’ takes a film-noir aesthetic, mixes it with a healthy amount of California grime and then adds a splash of femme fatale to both allure and disgust. It’s a tale of attraction and betrayal that fits the dark yet catchy melodies of the track perfectly.\n\n[Blood Orange: I’m Sorry We Lied](http://www.nowness.com/day/2012/5/24/2164/blood-orange-im-sorry-we-lied) on [Nowness.com](http://www.nowness.com/).",
