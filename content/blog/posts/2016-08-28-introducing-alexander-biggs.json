  "body": "**Alexander Biggs** popped up on my radar earlier this year, but it wasn’t until a few days ago that I really gave his tracks a proper listen, and pretty glad I did.\n\n With a debut single that clocked up an impressive 1/4mil streams on Spotify, it’s his latest track, _Tidal Wave_, that really sets up a project to truly believe in. Whilst the songwriting leans more toward the likes of Ben Howard and Keaton Henson, there’s a more distinctive rawness to the sound that allows it to remain firmly grounded, and all the better for it. Check out Tidal Wave below.\n\nLike this?
