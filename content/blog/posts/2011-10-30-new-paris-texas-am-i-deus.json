  "body": "Taking their name from the 1984 classic film **Paris, Texas**, this debut track from the London outfit is a lukewarm chillwave inspired affair.\n\nThere are times when _Am I Deus_ becomes slightly predictable, and the production on the vocals towards the start of the track doesn’t do full justice to what comes later on. Although it’s still early days, and this is the first outing from **Texas, Paris**, it appears that they could well be the UK’s answer to **Braids**. Check out _Am I Deus_ below.\n\n<a href=\"http://paris-texas.bandcamp.com/album/rio-de-janeiro-czech-republic\">Rio de Janeiro, Czech Republic by Paris,Texas</a>",
