  "date": "2013-10-07T09:35:08",
  "body": "Just the latest in a long line of exciting new artists to emerge from Australia, Byron Bay five piece **Tora** have just released their debut EP.\n\nSeven tracks of swirling, electronica influenced pop, drawing from the likes of SOHN, James Blake, and dare I say it, more R&B inspired numbers. With lead single _Calming Her_ gaining a lot of love on Hype Machine, Tora are rather bizarre in a way, in that they’re seemingly the opposite of the ‘make a shit load of noise’ model, keeping it somber yet beautiful, opting to rely on minimal, sparse beats and haunting vocals. Check out the full EP below, and keep up with them on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Toramusic).",
