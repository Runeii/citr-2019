  "body": "The latest track, Spark, from_ [Amber Run](https://www.</p><p>facebook.com/amberrunofficial) (_previously known as _Amber_ before they encountered a German Trance writer of the same name_)_ is every bit as fresh as the faces of these British chaps. Although very much an indie background, they definitely stamp their own sound onto the track.\n\nIf you’re new to Amber Run they’re kind of like a slightly angsty _Bastille_ shaking hands with _Noah and the Whale._ If that’s you’re thing then be sure to listen to their EP _Noah_ which was released in July of last year (if you don’t like the sound of that, check out their well-designed “wave” EP cover art).\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/138858312″ params=”color=0066cc&auto\\_play=false&hide\\_related=false&show\\_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]",
