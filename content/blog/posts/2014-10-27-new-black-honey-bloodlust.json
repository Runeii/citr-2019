  "body": "Something special is at work here.\n\nOnly four tracks in and **Black Honey** are churning out some of the most exciting guitar music of the last couple years. New track _Bloodlust_ features their signature harmonised guitar sound as well as the soaring vocals of frontwoman Izzy Bee that glide over the noughties styled production. This track marks the announcement of their debut E.P which will be released via Duly Noted Records. The exclusively physical release will only be available at gigs, which serves as even more of a reason to catch **Black Honey** live. Stream _Bloodlust_ below, alongside details of their debut London show:\n\nNovember – 02 – London (Notting Hill Arts Club)",
