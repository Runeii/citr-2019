  "title": "New: Jordan Rakei – Nerve",
  "date": "2017-08-02T17:39:11",
  "body": "**Jordan Rakei** is a genius.\n\nLatest track _Nerve_ is all kinds of glorious – perfect pop songwriting, silky smooth vocals and immaculate production to top it all off. Calling in Dave from The Invisible on guitar, it’s arguable more radio friendly than large moments of Rakei’s 2016 debut album, yet feels no less natural and organic. Check it out below, lifted from forthcoming album, Wallflower, out 22 September.",
