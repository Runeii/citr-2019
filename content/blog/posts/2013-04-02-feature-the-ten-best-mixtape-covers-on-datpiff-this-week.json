  "body": "[DatPiff](http://www.datpiff.com) is an awesome site. Even if you ignore the fact that it’s the premium location for finding new mixtapes, it has the hidden benefit of being a veritable cornucopia of cover art. Now, I didn’t want to ruin the magic of many of these album covers with small concerns like “what it actually sounds like”, so I take no responsibility for the quality of the music. Well then, without further ado, and in no particular order, I present my ten favourite pieces of artwork from DatPiff this week.\n\n**1) [A-Rodge – E.L.E.](http://www.datpiff.com/A-Rodge-Ele-mixtape.470650.html)**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/A-Rodge_Ele-front-large.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/20551-feature-the-ten-best-mixtape-covers-on-datpiff-this-week/attachment/a-rodge_ele-front-large/)\n\nJust take a moment and look at those eyes. There’s an endless expanse of pain and suffering that seems to seep out from them, I mean he’s smiling, but I’m far from convinced that he’s actually happy. It also probably doesn’t help that he looks like the lass from [Overly Attached Girlfriend](http://socialnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Overly-Attached-Girlfriend-Uses-Meme-For-Charity.png) meme. I’m also digging the backwards cap with the quiff poking through. It’s a strong look that balances gangsta style for the men out there, with a seductive, metrosexual tint for DA LAYDEEZ. I’ve also heard that bitches love comic sans.\n\n**2) [Various Artists – Beach Ballin](http://www.datpiff.com/Various-Artists-Ballers-Vol3-mixtape.470490.html)**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/beach-ballin.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/20551-feature-the-ten-best-mixtape-covers-on-datpiff-this-week/attachment/beach-ballin/)\n\nWhen observing a truly great piece of art, your mind should be awash with the questions you need to ask in order to comprehend the covert meaning of the imagery, and _Beach Ballin_ is no different. What’s the deal with that woman in the background to the left? Why is the bro in the middle staring at that the giant woman’s elbow? On that note, why is she so massive? What kind of man who is so close to a sack full of CA$H and has such a luminescent watch would drink out of a plastic cup? These are the kind of queries that make us human.\n\n**3) [Little Man! – It’s Lil’s … The Demo! (No Pen Or Paper!](http://www.datpiff.com/LITTLE-MAN-Its-Lils-The-Demo-no-Pen-Or-Paper-mixtape.470827.html))**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/LITTLE_MAN_Its_Lils_The_Demo_no_Pen_Or_Pap-front-large.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/20551-feature-the-ten-best-mixtape-covers-on-datpiff-this-week/attachment/little_man_its_lils_the_demo_no_pen_or_pap-front-large/)\n\nIt’s Little Man! This cover upsets me slightly! The man is holding a fist full of cash, yet claims he can’t afford a pen or paper, or, seemingly, a shirt! That displays a serious issue with dealing with the realities of everyday life! At least he has that cleaver, so he can hunt his own food, because, with his inability to even sort out the appropriate level of his stationary needs, I feel that going to the supermarket might be beyond him!\n\n**4) [Boy Logix & InFiniti – Ass Nation](http://www.datpiff.com/Boy-Logix-Ass-Nation-mixtape.470788.html)**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Boy_Logix_InFiniti_Ass_Nation-front-large.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/20551-feature-the-ten-best-mixtape-covers-on-datpiff-this-week/attachment/boy_logix_infiniti_ass_nation-front-large/)\n\nIf there’s one thing that I’ve learnt in my 24 years, it’s that there’s no such thing as too much ass or too much lens flare.\n\n**5) [Jfrass – Easter Bashment It Tun Over 2013](http://www.datpiff.com/jfrass-Easter-Bashment-It-Tun-Over-2013-mixtape.470563.html)**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/jfrass_Easter_Bashment_It_Tun_Over_2013-front-large.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/20551-feature-the-ten-best-mixtape-covers-on-datpiff-this-week/attachment/jfrass_easter_bashment_it_tun_over_2013-front-large/)\n\nJfrass does not fuck with the whole “reading something from top-to-bottom” tradition, he’s far too much of a badass for that. Truthfully though, if I was his size and towered over a room of shadow people, I too would disregard the traditions of the written word. Got to say, I hope Jfrass is getting some money for that Usain Bolt advert, otherwise the athlete is just taking advantage of the “The Mix Master’s” fame.\n\n**6) [King Pimpin – King Pimping Muzik Volume 2 Hoodbound Edition](http://www.datpiff.com/King-Pimpin-King-Pimpin-Muzik-Volume-2-Hoodbound-Edition-mixtape.470412.html)**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/King_Pimpin_King_Pimpin_Muzik_Volume_2_Hoodbound_E-front-large.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/20551-feature-the-ten-best-mixtape-covers-on-datpiff-this-week/attachment/king_pimpin_king_pimpin_muzik_volume_2_hoodbound_e-front-large/)\n\nPhotoshop is a phenomenal tool. It still amazes me that images can be edited in such a seamless manner that, fifty years ago, experts would have been unlikely to recognise them as fake. Now, I’m not wholly confident that this has image has been edited at all, as surely anyone who would grant themselves the moniker “King Pimpin” would possess their own throne from which to pimp. Otherwise, they’d have to call themselves “Manager Pimpin” or “Associate Pimping”, and I don’t believe King Pimpin would lie to me like that.\n\n**7) [The Drew Feat. Lil John Marine Brown – The Drew Dope Shit](http://www.datpiff.com/the-drew-ftlil-john-marine-brown-The-Drew-Dope-Shit-mixtape.470514.html)**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/the_drew_ftlil_john_marine_brown_The_Drew_Dope_Shi-front-large.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/20551-feature-the-ten-best-mixtape-covers-on-datpiff-this-week/attachment/the_drew_ftlil_john_marine_brown_the_drew_dope_shi-front-large/)\n\nSometimes, I feel that artists just put in too much effort, what happened to nonchalance?\n\n**8) [ZooBoyChapo – This Is All I Know Part 1](http://www.datpiff.com/ZooBoyChapo-This-Is-All-I-Know-Part1-mixtape.470536.html)**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ZooBoyChapo_This_Is_All_I_Know_Part1-front-large.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/20551-feature-the-ten-best-mixtape-covers-on-datpiff-this-week/attachment/zooboychapo_this_is_all_i_know_part1-front-large/)\n\nThis might be the most awesome thing I’ve ever seen. It’s pure $$$WAG visualised in motherfucking SPACE. There are dollars, UFOs AND a submarine.\n\n**9) [Killa Throwed & Day Beatz – UFO Fly](http://www.datpiff.com/Killa-Throwed-Ufo-Fly-2013-mixtape.470137.html)**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Killa_Throwed_DayBeatZ_Ufo_Fly_2013-front-large.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/20551-feature-the-ten-best-mixtape-covers-on-datpiff-this-week/attachment/killa_throwed_daybeatz_ufo_fly_2013-front-large/)\n\nNow this guy I don’t like. I’m not sure if it’s that unsettling leer, his glowing third nipple or simply the fact that he’s swearing at me.\n\n**10) [NOAH – Tha Chronicles Of Noah (Di$Tibution)](http://www.datpiff.com/NOAH-The-Chronicles-Of-Noah-ditibution-mixtape.471180.html)**\n\n[\\>![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/NOAH_The_Chronicles_Of_Noah_ditibution-front-large.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/20551-feature-the-ten-best-mixtape-covers-on-datpiff-this-week/attachment/noah_the_chronicles_of_noah_ditibution-front-large/)\n\nThere’s nothing quite like staring off into the middle distance to make me perceive you as a deep-thinker and/or philosopher. Hold on, what’s this? Military insignia? Is it possible that NOAH has a violent edge to his musings? Maybe, but then, maybe not. All I know is that whatever he’s pondering, it’s going to be a weighty and serious topic.\n\nSo, there we have it. The Ten Best Mixtape Covers On DatPiff this week is over. We’ve learnt a lot, had some emotional moments and come out the other side better, smarter and with more SWAGGER. #thuglyf",
