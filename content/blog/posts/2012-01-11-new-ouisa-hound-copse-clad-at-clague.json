  "body": "You may remember that I included Ohio’s **Ouisa Hound** in my [Sound of 2012](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13124-sound-of-2012-part-3-josh/) list, for his gorgeously enticing two debut tracks. Well, earlier today **Ouisa Hound** shared a new piece via Soundcloud, in the form of the fifteen minute drone-inspired _Copse Clad At Clague_. Shifting gears slickly between hip-hop and ambient soundscapes, this is ambitious even by his standards, yet it works fantastically. The sheer level of immersion felt whilst listening to _Copse Clad…_ is unparalleled, and will hopefully go someway to rightfully cementing his name as a producer to really keep an eye out for.\n\n**Ouisa Hound’s** debut record _**The Joy Eclectic**_ is set to be released within the next couple of weeks.\n\n [Copse Clad at Clague](http://soundcloud.com/ouisa-hound/copse-clad-at-clague) by [Ouisa Hound](http://soundcloud.com/ouisa-hound)",
