  "body": "My favorite LA band **MUNA** have just returned with a new track _Promise_ and oh boy, it’s a cracker.\n\nDrenched in their beautifully 80’s infused anthemia, the jumping basslines and crushing drums stand as the perfect backdrop to the stark lyrical themes, delivered in typically great fashion from lead singer Katie Gavin. Oh, and be sure not to miss the gloriously over the top guitar solo during the songs closing minute. This is how pop music should be.\n\nBe sure to see more of Katie, Josette and Naomi in the near future.\n\nFollow our [Spotify On Repeat playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a hand-picked selection of the current hottest tracks.",
