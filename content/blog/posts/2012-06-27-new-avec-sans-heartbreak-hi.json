I cannot tell you just how long I’ve been waiting for this song, and it doesn’t disappoint.\n\nSince discovering London duo **Avec Sans** via a bandcamp trawl a couple of months back, with their audacious debut track _[Perth](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/16045-video-avec-sans-perth-bon-iver-cover/)_ (a cover of **Bon Iver**), turning a melancholic song into an indie disco anthem. _Heartbreak Hi_ is a gorgeous slice of upbeat synth pop, complete with singalong chorus and sickly sweet hook. Could **Avec Sans** be the UK’s answer to **Purity Ring**? Quite possibly.",
