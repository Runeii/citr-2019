  "body": "[**Graphics**’](http://www.facebook.com/thisisgraphics) brand-new cut, _There’s A Way Back_, is one of those tracks that could very easily be swamped within London’s ever prominent ‘industrial beat world’. This would be a shame, as there’s something inherently artful and focused to be found within his work.\n\nWith _There’s A Way Back_**_,_** the track clings to a central set of voice samples. They cling to the track like a shuffling set of disillusioned youths, pining and scratching for some sort of emotive response. Surrounding them, is a beat that almost mocks them in its groove, the voices chasing the beats’ elegant throb.\n\nStream the track below, and pick up Graphics’ 12-inch out Dec. 12th on [GETME!](http://www.thisisgetme.com/)",
