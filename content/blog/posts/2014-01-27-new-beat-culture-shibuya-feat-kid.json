  "date": "2014-01-27T21:14:51",
  "body": "I have a huge amount of respect for **Beat Culture** and the way that he’s gone about releasing his music.\n\nGiven the colossal amount of interest in his initial output, it would have been all too easy to simply maintain the same formula, and much too his credit and gain, he’s changed things up, with a new direction in sound. _Shibuya_, the second of the two A-sides that make up his most recent single is quite possibly his best track to date. Glistening synth sections merge seamlessly with the vocals of Kid A – this deserves to be soundtracking every uber cool party this summer.",
