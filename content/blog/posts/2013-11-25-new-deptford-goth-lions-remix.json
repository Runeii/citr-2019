  "date": "2013-11-25T22:13:16",
  "body": "Like a late night walk in the streets of London with a flurry of thoughts running through your mind.\n\nAll the mental commotion, but somehow you feel so calm—Thats how I would describe Mute’s remix of Lions by Deptford Goth. I’ve always admired Deptford Goth’s somber sounds and glossy piano’s, but its refreshing to hear his voice so distorted. To hear his melodies turned gritty.  It’s a side of Deptford that I wouldn’t mind hearing again.\n\nIf a little mental journey is something you’re looking for you should probably hit play. (Best with headphones and the lights out)\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/121684736″ width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]",
