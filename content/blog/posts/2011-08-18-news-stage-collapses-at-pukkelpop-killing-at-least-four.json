  "body": "With the saddening news of a [stage collapse](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRkdwrmzYXg) at the **Indiana State Fair** just under a week ago, which took the lives of five people and left dozens of others injured, it’s devastating to report another similar incident at a major festival. Just under an hour ago, the Chateau stage at **Pukkelpop**, Belgium collapsed due to adverse weather conditions. The Associated Press reports that at least four three people have been killed, as equipment fell from the stage as **Smith Westerns** were playing.\n\nTheir frontman **Cullen Omori** took to [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/SmithWesterns) to tell fans, _‘”Stage collapsed max almost got crushed by the tress. I hope pukkelpop has insurance bc all our shit is broke”_ however the tweet was quickly removed and replaced by the more sensitive offering of _“Praying no one got hurt. Wtf”._ More than 60,000 people were expected to attend the event  which featured the likes of **The Offspring**, **Eminem**, **Foo Fighters** and **Kasabian**. Our thoughts and condolences go out to all those affected.\n\nUpdates as we get them.\n\n19/11/10 Update: The PA now reports that five people have been confirmed to have died in the tragic incident yesterday. **Pukkelpop** 2011 has been cancelled whilst investigations are being led into the stage collapse.\n\nThe festival released the following statement:\n\n_‘Pukkelpop is in deep mourning. We truly sympathise with the families and friends of the victims. Words are not enough. We have struggled with the decision to continue the festival. Therefore we have decided to cancel Pukkelpop 2011. What has happened is very exceptional and could not have been predicted. We are deeply moved by all the spontaneous support the festivalgoers and the organisation have received. We call on all Pukkelpoppers to return home calmly. Extra buses and trains have been organised to bring everybody home. We ask everyone to understand that this decision was extremely difficult to make.’_\n\n7:56: The Antlers [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#%21/theantlers): ‘so the stage we’re supposed to play tomorrow at **Pukkelpop** collapsed and people were killed. our hearts go out to everyone there.’\n\n8:00 Reports now saying that trees were uprooted by high speed winds, and brought down the sound and light rigs.\n\n8:03 30 Seconds To Mars frontman Jared Leto on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#%21/jaredleto): _‘PUKKELPOP UPDATE: Two confirmed dead. 40 at the hospital. Sending our thoughts and prayers’_\n\n8:14\n\n9:46 Associated Press reports that three people have been killed with 10 severely injured and another 60 with minor injuries.\n\n10:05 Smith Westerns frontman Cullen Omori has released the following statement: _‘We had just finished the first song of our set at Pukkelpop when the stage/tent started shaking and simply thought it was a storm passing through. I made a comment about Cheap Trick and we were about to play the next one when our tour manager yelled at me to run off the stage. Right then the tress collapsed 1 foot in front of \\[guitarist\\] Max \\[Kakacek\\]. At this point we thought only the stage broke, not the tent. Amid the chaos it was hard to tell exactly what had happened, but after the rescue teams started coming in it became clear that there were severe injuries and we are now being told there are reports of multiple deaths. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families who lost loved ones in today’s tragedy.’_\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tent-large.png \"Tent Pukkelpop\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tent-large.png)\n\nImage from [drytheriver](http://yfrog.com/gyeuctmj)\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tree-large.png \"Tree Pukkelpop\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tree-large.png)Image from [j\\_somers](http://yfrog.com/z/klbn8mgj)\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/AXJf80GCEAALmzS-660x441.jpg \"Weather Damage\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/AXJf80GCEAALmzS.jpg)\n\nImage from [moustiquemag](http://twitter.com/#!/moustiquemag)",
