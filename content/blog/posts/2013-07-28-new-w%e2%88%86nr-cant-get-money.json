  "body": "∆’s are still all the rage.\n\nOregon soulster (yeah I just made that word up), **W∆NR **(**Bryce Miller & Mitchell Winters**) have just released what appears to be their debut single, and it’s the musical equivalent of Grimes riding a pug around Berlin. By that I mean that it’s VERY current/cool sounding. Slick R&B vibes, sleazy synths and of course those JT via The Weeknd vocals, combined with the black and white imagery, makes for what is certain to be ‘a buzz track’, and on the quality of it, deservedly so. Check out _Can’t Get Money_ below.",
