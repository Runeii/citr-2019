  "body": "Arguably one of the strongest new music tracks I’ve heard in 2015, Kamau’s ‘Jusfayu’ is full of charisma, charm, and an unabated joy which is underlined with a sense of playful melancholy.\n\nCaptioned with the short statement of ‘A song about one way romance’, the repetitive nature of the track furthers the exasperation held in the lead vocal line that conveys a sense of pleading which is already conscious of it’s own futility. Threading this message together is an undeniably brilliant series of pop melodies and hooks, along with stellar production from New Zealand trio No Wyld. This concludes in tying together a brilliant track that you will no doubt have on repeat for a while.",
