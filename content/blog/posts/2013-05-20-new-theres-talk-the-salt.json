  "body": "San Francisco’s **There’s Talk**, the project of **Olivia Lee**, may be less than a year old, but new track, and first single proper, The Salt, is one of the most ambitious tracks of 2013 thus far.\n\nCapturing the raw emotion of **Youth Lagoon** with the refined edge of **Oupa**, it’s a stirring, tearful ballad, that’s both remorseful and overflowing with hope. Check out The Salt below.",
