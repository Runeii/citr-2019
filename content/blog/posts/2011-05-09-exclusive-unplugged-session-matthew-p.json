Having already featured on **Crack In The Road**, **Matthew P**, through **Fiction Records**, is currently in the process of releasing a series of free tracks which will make up his debut EP. We were fortunate enough to catch up with **Matt** before he headed off to a gig in Liverpool, and below you can witness the fruits of our labour. Enjoy!\n\n**The Breakfast Song:**\n\n**Rolling On:**\n\n**Gilly:**\n\n**Patty:**",
