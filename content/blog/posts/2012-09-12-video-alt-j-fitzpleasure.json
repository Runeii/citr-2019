Much like the band’s video to ‘Tessellate’, it’s a gothic mix of religious imagery and gang culture, and serves as not only a beautifully fitting video to the darkest track on the album, but also – through its top quality production values – gives an inkling as to just how successful the band have become. Check it out below.\n\n[ALT-J “Fitzpleasure”](http://vimeo.com/49246286) from [COSA](http://vimeo.com/cosa) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
