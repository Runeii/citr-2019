  "body": "The nights are drawing in, the sun barely graces us with it’s presence, and each morning greets us with a undesirable layer of frost, coating every inch of our lives.\n\nThis track from Boston based trio [**Leisure**](http://www.facebook.com/Leisuremusic?sk=wall) couldn’t be more fitting. Melancholic, utterly vulnerable and willingly understanding. The minimal beat and simplistic piano chords ground much of _Green Light_, whilst the tender vocals elevate the track to transcendental levels. Stunningly bewitching.\n\n_Green Light_ is released on 7″ via [Crash Symbols](http://crashsymbols.bandcamp.com/album/green-light) at the turn of the year. Check out the video below.\n\n[Leisure – Green Light](http://vimeo.com/31443340) from [Crash Symbols](http://vimeo.com/user8989157) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
