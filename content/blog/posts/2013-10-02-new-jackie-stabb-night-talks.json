  "body": "Photo: Steven King\n\nHaving taken a trip to LA earlier in the year, **Jackie Stabb** aka CitR favourite Chelsea Burgin has offered up new track _Night Talks_ as the first cut from the recording sessions.\n\nPerhaps cleaner and certainly more chorus orientated than her previous endeavours, it certainly feels like a natural musical development, reminding me of a softer Yeah Yeah Yeahs, or in part like the more accessible moments of Broken Social Scene. Check out _Night Talks_ below, taken from her forthcoming EP, and keep up with Jackie Stabb over at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/JackieStabb).",
