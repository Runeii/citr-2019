The Canadian group found a great balance between experimentation and accessibility on their first release and they appear to have continued in this vein on ‘Amends’. Their newest track toys with repetition, the music rolling and bubbling underneath Raphaelle Standell-Preston’s seductive vocals, and, after a couple of listens, it does a fantastic job of worming itself into your head.\n\n‘Amends’, which is being released as a double A-side 12″ alongside ‘In Kind’ is released on 11th June and you can pre-order it [here](http://braidsmusic.com/InKind//Amends).",
