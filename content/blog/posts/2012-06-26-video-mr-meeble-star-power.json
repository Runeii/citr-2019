  "body": "Self-proclaimed “epic electronic glitch rock”, **Mr.**\n\n**Meeble’s** music is a narcotic blend of 80’s disco and more experimental, prog styles. New video for single _Star Power_ is a bizarrely yet beautifully crafted affair, coming across like something out of I-Robot blended with The Matrix. It may not be ground breaking nor set to storm the charts, but it’s wonderfully enjoyable and strangely addictive. Take a journey with **Mr. Meeble** below.",
