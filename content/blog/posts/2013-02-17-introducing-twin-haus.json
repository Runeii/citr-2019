  "body": "Whenever I’m asked about which areas of the world have the most vibrant music scenes, there’s always one name that springs to mind immediately; Australia.\n\nWith a population just over a third the size of the UK’s, it’s pretty impressive that at this moment in time, there’s far more exciting acts coming from down-under than Britain. In about an hour or so the UK album charts are set to be announced, and it’s fairly likely that Foals will have achieved their first number one record, so it seems fitting that this track from Brisbane’s Twin Haus takes a Foals-esque sound, and does it far better than anything on Holy Fire.\n\nLumberjack Loveshack (Part 1) is as melodic and brooding as it is epic; a true masterpiece of a track. Check it out below.",
