Anyway, LA’s [**League**](http://www.facebook.com/leaguesound) create the sort of music that makes you want to pick up a guitar and write the best song ever known to man. Their new EP How Do I Know is comprised of three tracks of **Beach Boys** inspired surf-pop, totaling up to ten minutes of unrelenting sugary goodness. Second track _Your World_ has a similar vibe to 80’s **Cure**, combined with a healthy dose of caffeine and energy drinks. These are songs that should be soundtracking teenage years all around the planet, with their racy spirit and lively feel, it may not be summer anymore, but fortunately for us, **League** didn’t get the memo.\n\n<a href=\"http://leaguesound.bandcamp.com/album/how-do-i-know-ep\">How Do I Know EP by LEAGUE</a>",
