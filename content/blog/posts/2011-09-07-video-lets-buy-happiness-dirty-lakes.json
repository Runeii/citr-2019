  "body": "**[Let’s Buy Happiness](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Lets-Buy-Happiness/128399670820)** have just dropped the official video for their new single, Dirty Lakes.  The track itself is great, **Sarah Halls**’ vocals are impeccably adorable as ever, with the video mirroring the playful attitude the track wears on its sleeve. Shot on a shipyard in Wallsend and Druridge bBay beach, the back drop is barren and sparse, a perfect juxtaposition to the warm and refined sound the band have a habit of pulling off so well.\n\nStream the video below, and be sure to download the single when it’s released on September 26. Head over to their [Bandcamp](http://letsbuyhappiness.bandcamp.com/) for more information",
