  "date": "2012-10-08T22:51:30",
  "body": "With a stompingly dirty bassline that would have **Sonic Youth** gleefully rubbing their hands together, _Becky’s Back_, the debut single from Baltimore’s **Wildhoney** is three minutes of blisteringly hot rock and roll.\n\nTearing through the verses into the rip-roaring chorus of ‘let us not forget’, you’ll have it etched to the inside of your eardrums after a solitary listen. Taken from their first EP out on 20 October, this lead track is a promising sign of things to come.",
