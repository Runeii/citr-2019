  "body": "There is nothing quite as satisfying as the moment in which a piece of music matches a situation absolutely, and today Eaves has found himself in the intersection of my ‘Music vs Life’ Venn diagram.\n\nApparently the solo project of Leeds based Joseph Lyons, you’d be forgiven for thinking that this music had been created in the wilds of a rural abyss, or across the journey of a weary, world hardened life time. Drawing immediate comparisons to the likes of Villagers, Alexi Murdoch, Eddie Vedder, and the great Jeff Buckley, Eaves’ small collection of demos are achingly beautiful.\n\nLittle Rock is full of enlightening subtleties, completely capturing the listener’s attention and covering itself over their mind as a healing rub. If this is the quality of a demo, we cannot wait to hear this potential realised in a fully fledged release.",
