  "body": "Combining two of my favourite pastimes; the videos of Tyler T Williams and music originating from Boise, Idaho, garage rock outfit **Gayze** get it completely spot on with their new two track video _Done To My Love / East Coast Dying_.\n\nHaving made his name with videos for **[Youth Lagoon](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/11026-video-youth-lagoon-%E2%80%93-montana/)** and **[Coma Cinema](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/5344-video-coma-cinema-blue-suicide/)** (amongst others), it’s the fitting and unique narratives that Williams applies to each and every video that put him amongst the best around. A real 60’s throwback, **Gayze** are slick, (at times) raucous and utterly immersive, yet there’s a more sinister side to their music that Tyler enhances brilliantly. The ability of **Williams** to narrate a story without overwhelming the viewer with details is second to none, a trait that lends his entire catalogue of work to repeated plays. Check out the visuals below, then grab **Gayze’s** fantastic debut release [Black Soul](http://bleedinggoldrecords.bandcamp.com/album/bg036-black-soul). Also, peep an interview with Williams via our friends at [Portals](http://www.portalsmusic.com/2013/01/sights/gayze-done-to-my-love-east-coast-dying-official-video/).\n\n[Gayze](http://vimeo.com/57045275) from [Tyler T Williams](http://vimeo.com/tylertwilliams) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
