  "body": "If there’s one aspect of the internet’s role in promoting music that we tend to overlook, it’s the metaphorical flattening of the land, making it far easier for any musician, anywhere in the world to have their music heard.\n\nSure, there’s no denying the fact that it’s still more difficult for an act from Central Africa to gain a following than it is for an act from Central London, but the scales are slowly becoming less and less biased. Greek duo [**Plastic Flowers**](http://plasticflowers.eu/) are a true testament to this, having only been together for two years and already garned quite a following online, as well as the chance to play at this years SXSW Festival in Texas.\n\nWith their fantastic new EP _**Aftermath**_ released days ago (through [Manic Pop! Records](http://store.manicpoprecords.com/products/507676-plastic-flowers-aftermath-ep)), featuring the beautiful CitR reviewed [_In You I’m Lost_](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/18259-video-plastic-flowers-in-you-im-lost/), the only way is up for this ‘self-desctructive pop’ group. We’re delighted to be able to bring you the first viewing of the visuals to accompany the EP’s lead track, _Dead Promises_, a twisted yet strangely well-rounded gem, drawing from early 00’s chart-busting pop and 90’s shoegaze. A video with a real organic feel to it, it’s a perfect reflection on the minimal, emotive and ever-so magical sounds of **Plastic Flowers**. Check it out below (directed by [the cOre](thecorereel.com)), as well as the EP underneath that, which is available on 7″ vinyl and name your price download.\n\n[PLASTIC FLOWERS – DEAD PROMISES](http://vimeo.com/58182565) from [Stathis M. “one of the cOre”](http://vimeo.com/stathismourdoukoutas) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
