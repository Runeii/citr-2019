  "body": "You knew it was on it’s way.\n\nHaving been characteristically quiet since the launch of their initiative the Paul Institute a matter of days ago, _Landcruisin’_, the debut solo track from **A. K. Paul** received it’s debut play on Beats1 earlier this evening. It’s ambitious, over the top and blows the impersonators out the waters. They fashioned the game, and now they’re reinventing it. I’ve missed Ghana. Check it below, and if you’re a member of the [Paul Institute](http://paul.institute/members) you can grab a signed vinyl.\n\nFollow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
