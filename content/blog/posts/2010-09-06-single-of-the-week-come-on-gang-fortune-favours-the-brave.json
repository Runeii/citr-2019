Featuring an uplifting chorus sure to make feet dance; the lyrical content is very much focused on the trials and tribulations of being an angst filled teenager. “_If this is being young, it isn’t easy_” laments lead singer and drummer Sarah, her voice containing venomous understanding. With the band gearing up for an expansive UK tour, make sure to check them out at their upcoming live dates!\n\n[Check Out Come On Gang!’s Myspace!](http://www.myspace.com/comeongangmusic)\n\n[Download Fortune Favours The Brave!
