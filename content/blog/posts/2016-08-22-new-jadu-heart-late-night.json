  "body": "The debut EP from **jadu heart** had me absolutely hooked.\n\nReleased via Mura Masa’s AP Sound label, their follow-up single and the first lifted from their second EP, _Late Night_, is another slice of magic. Arguably a more accessible sound, there’s elements of early Foals in the hook, mixed with some silky smooth production. Check it out below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
