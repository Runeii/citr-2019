  "body": "Installations of isolated objects, placed in such a way you assume some relationship, although you can’t quite tell whether the pieces are found or artisan made, they seam to have a more industrial/commercially produced quality about them.\n\nAbigail is interested in shared cultural conceptions of things and places we have often never been, informed by popular culture, media etc. we have assumptions we don’t even realise.\n\nPlaying with this she combines soft pastel interior shots that _feel_ like California- looking at that squashy old velvet chair, knowing what a sun warmed living room with tacky vases and wicker magazine racks would smell and feel like, the stuffiness and dustiness in the air- with plaster, glass, granite and metal. Examining that moment of cognition where you see something familiar in an unfamiliar place, the moment of discovery in the isolated context.\n\nAbigail breaks down the elements of this imagined knowledge and presents them to us, extrapolated, sometimes partially faulty, sometimes eerily perfect. The almost clinical, clean-cut whiteness of the space, with the undoubtedly painstakingly thought out placement of the artefacts- ultimately leaves you with an un-comfortability that unsettles that first feeling of recognition. You are left a bit silent and dumbstruck amongst the cold objects, and question whether you really do know what that room smells like at all.\n\n#gallery-1 { margin: auto; } #gallery-1 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } #gallery-1 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-1 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } /\\* see gallery\\_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php \\*/\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Abigail-Booth-Installation-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22757-artist-profile-abigail-booth/attachment/abigail-booth-installation)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Abigail-Booth-Digital-print-+-Base-Stone-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22757-artist-profile-abigail-booth/attachment/abigail-booth-digital-print-base-stone)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Ambigail-Booth-17414-+-Maastricht--150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22757-artist-profile-abigail-booth/attachment/ambigail-booth-17414-maastricht)\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Abigail-Booth-Fourth-Wall-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22757-artist-profile-abigail-booth/attachment/abigail-booth-fourth-wall)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Fuji_Film_II_Sun_City-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22757-artist-profile-abigail-booth/attachment/fuji_film_ii_sun_city)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Fuji_Film_III_Sun_City1-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22757-artist-profile-abigail-booth/attachment/fuji_film_iii_sun_city1)\n\n  \n\nFor other works, visit Abigail’s site [here](http://www.abigailbooth.com/).",
