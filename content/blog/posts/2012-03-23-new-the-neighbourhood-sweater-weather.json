  "date": "2012-03-23T19:12:41",
  "body": "With their debut track _Female Robbery_ causing quite a stir, California’s **The Neighbourhood** will be hoping for a similar reaction to their second offering, _Sweater Weather_.\n\nPremiered on **Zane Lowe’s** Radio 1 show yesterday evening as ‘Hottest Record In The World’, it continues in a similar slickhop vein, opening with the telling line _‘All I am, is a man, I want the world, in my hands’_ coming across smoother and more refined than any other act around at the moment. Described by lead singer **Jesse Rutherford** as a ‘love song’, it’s nostalgic, insanely addictive and destined to propel them to bigger and better things. Check out the track below and grab a free download.",
