  "body": "Mr.\n\nChameleon himself, (**Joseph Zucco**), abandoned the much beloved **[Teenage Reverb](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/3728-interview-teenage-reverb/ \"Interview: Teenage Reverb\")** at the tail end of last year to replace him with the now equally hyped **[J£ZUS MILLION](http://soundcloud.com/jezusmilli)**. The records that followed the gear change were cleaner, more hip focused and all together more distinctive in their execution. Take his early drop, **_[Benefits](http://soundcloud.com/jezusmilli/benefits)_**, half chillwave, half freak-hop, it was a jumbled and multi faceted take on hip-hop.\n\nIf this new remix is anything to go by, it’s clear that we’re not the only ones impressed by Mr. **Zucc**o. His remix of **Alex Winston**’s Choice Notes is perhaps a more conservative effort, regardless, it’s smooth, effortless and gives the original a much needed kick into life.",
