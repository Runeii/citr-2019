  "body": "Have released my favourite album of 2012, with his self-titled masterpiece, NY based producer Evan Shornstein aka **Photay**, has dropped a free download of a new track to celebrate 400 downloads of said album.\n\n_Static At The Summit_ is a glitchy track, without the sort of percussion dominance found on his debut LP, but still showcasing the immense talent of this unique producer. With 400 downloads (of what is a free album) being a criminally low number for such a fantastic record, check out the new track below, then grab the full [LP here](http://photay.bandcamp.com/).",
