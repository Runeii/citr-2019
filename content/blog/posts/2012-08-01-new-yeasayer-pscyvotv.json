This internet-wide scavenger hunt for the unreleased tracks taken from upcoming album _Fragrant World_ has, predictably, been solved rather quickly. Whilst half a dozen songs are still missing, four – ‘Blue Paper’, ‘No Bones’, ‘Reagan’s Skeleton’ and ‘Damaged Goods’ have already been found, and we’ve got them for you below. There’s nothing particularly surprising, and the **Yeasayer** hallmarks are all there, but the step away from pop and into the slightly more psychedelic should keep interest heightened whilst the rest of the tracks are hunted down.\n\n**UPDATE:** the entire album is now up on YouTube. The playlist is below.\n\nThe album’s tracklisting is as follows:\n\n1\\. Fingers Never Bleed  \n2\\. Longevity  \n3\\. Blue Paper  \n4\\. Henrietta  \n5\\. Devil and the Deed  \n6\\. No Bones  \n7\\. Reagan’s Skeleton  \n8\\. Demon Road  \n9\\. Damaged Goods  \n10\\. Folk Hero Schtick  \n11\\. Glass of the Microscope",
