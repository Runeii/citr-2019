All I was doing when I was 16 was wanking too much, all the name of ‘self discovery’. In a way so is **Beat Culture**, all be It in a much less juvenile way. His debut LP, _Goldenbacked Weaver_, is a slagheap of sounds and textures, with each one carefully restored to form something beautiful and bold. He flutters and jumps from genre to genre in a way that shrieks of someone only just discovering his art, yet meanwhile he does with such flair you’d be forgiven for thinking he was a lot older. Samples and tones are grabbed from what seems like anywhere, the beats are crisp and deep and ultimately it’s crazy and schizophrenic enough to keep you hooked until the very last track.\n\nBelieve the hype and download the LP below.",
