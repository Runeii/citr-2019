  "body": "Almost a month to the day, **Dam Mantle**’s single ‘_Not a Word_’ was our [single of the week](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/8666-single-of-the-week-dam-mantle-not-a-word/ \"Single Of The Week: Dam Mantle – Not A Word\"). It had one of those hooks that had a consuming way of staying with you, the message still ingrained long after the final beat. The EP it was taken from, _We_, has just gone up for stream. At a base level it’s a dubstep album, beneath, Mantle’s confident ability to manipulate human cries gives it an uncomfortable human element, that brings with it sadness and longing.\n\nStream the full EP over at [One Thirty BPM.](http://onethirtybpm.com/media/full-ep-stream-dam-mantle-we-ep/)",
