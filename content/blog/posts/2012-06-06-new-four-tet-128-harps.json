  "date": "2012-06-06T10:46:59",
  "body": "**Kieran Hebden** is, in my mind, one of the most innovative producers of all time, even if just for his intense attention to detail.\n\nCase in point: new track _128 Harps_, blending classical instrumentation sections with wiry beats and spliced vocal samples. Where **Four Tet** excels is through the journey he guides the listener along, seeing his music as more of a palette than merely a four minute expanse of time that needs filling, and you can’t help but feel that he’s getting better all the time.",
