  "body": "Dream-pop tracks can be truly sensational, however my main gripe with a fairly sizable proportion of them is in their length, choosing to opt for short and snappy rather than slow burning and epic.\n\nThankfully, this new track from Athens duo **I Come To Shanghai** opts for my preferred approach, mixing the surf induced vibes of **Braids** with a trained ear for vocal harmonies. Download _In Your Own Way_ below, and head over to the **I Come To Shanghai** [bandcamp](http://icometoshanghai.bandcamp.com/album/in-your-own-way) to check out an official remix of the track by **Whitney Gould** of **SPORTS**, under the **Heart Island** moniker.\n\n[In Your Own Way](http://soundcloud.com/icometoshanghai/in-your-own-way) by [IComeToShanghai](http://soundcloud.com/icometoshanghai)",
