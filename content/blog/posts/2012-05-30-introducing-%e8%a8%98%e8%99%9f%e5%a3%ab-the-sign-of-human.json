  "body": "I’m going to be honest with you here, my Taiwanese is rubbish, some might even describe it as non-existent.\n\nThankfully the language of music is universal, and Taiwan’s **記號士 THE SIGN OF HUMAN** exploit this to it’s core. With their dark yet somehow alluring imagery and unfathomable name, they’re intriguing from the get go, and it’s an aesthetic that perfectly suits their melancholic shoegaze sound. Taking inspiration from the likes of **Ride** and **Slowdive**, the guitars are languid and drowned in distortion whilst the vocals are poignant and distinctively clear, even if they are sung in a foreign language (excuse my ignorance). Check out the full EP below, and keep up with **記號士 THE SIGN OF HUMAN** via their [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/THESIGNOFHUMAN) page.",
