  "body": "Having [caught onto](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/12387-introducing-midi-matilda/) San Francisco’s **Midi Matilda** fairly early on, it’s fantastic to see them leaving the nest and spreading their wings over the pages of other similar websites. New single _Ottawa_ will undoubtedly do the same as it’s predecessors, with it’s upbeat, **M83** synth pop slickness and insanely catchy chorus. Check it out below, and download their _**Red** **Light District EP**_ via [bandcamp](http://midimatilda.bandcamp.com/).\n\nPhoto Credit – [Bryan Byrne](http://www.brianbyrnephoto.com/)",
