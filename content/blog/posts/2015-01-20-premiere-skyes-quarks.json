  "body": "In recent years, we’ve seen Brooklyn’s music scene move away from the scuzzy, indie rock and roll that defined it in the early 00’s, instead replaced by slicker, more experimental electro-pop.\n\nAt the centre of this modern movement are enigmatic four piece **SKYES**, who having made a considerable impression last year, with their two initial singles, A Girl Named Jake and Burden, are setting their stall out in 2015 with new single, _Quarks_, lifted from an EP out later in the year. Dramatic and audacious in nature, it’s a bold composition, finding focus in the vocals of lead singer Dallin Knightly, it sits somewhere between the anthemic pop of Paramore and the fluorescent harmonies of Ou Est Le Swimming Pool. Building to a mighty finale, it’s ambitious and an undisputed  statement of intent. Check out Quarks below alongside previous single, A Girl Named Jake, and keep up with the quartet on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SkyesMusic).",
