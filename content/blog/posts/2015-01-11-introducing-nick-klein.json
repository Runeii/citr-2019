Hailing ftom the Netherlands, **Nick Klein** (Klein & producer Ferdous Dehzad) have a sound that is very much of the moment; we’re talking Jai Paul, Ben Khan, Oceaan etc., yet perhaps without the polished edge that Khan and Paul especially are known for. The vocal quality seems to fluctuate slightly, from sublime to perhaps slightly underproduced, however I’m assuming that these are almost entirely bedroom producer tracks, so can’t really draw too many faults. Check out _Paralyzed_ and _Break Away_ below.",
