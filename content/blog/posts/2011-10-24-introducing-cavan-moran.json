  "body": "Manchester’s [**Cavan Moran**](http://www.facebook.com/cavanmoran?ref=ts&sk=info) must be influenced by **Bright Eyes**. The songwriting similarities are rather eerie at times, most prominently found within the vocal delivery and the eloquent lyricism. That said, with **Conor Oberst** being one of my favourite musicians of all time, I’m a sucker for charming poetry and Americana inspired vocals. _Until The End_, the opening track of his debut EP is a fine example of insightful, heart-warming songwriting. A love song that finds **Moran** in his absolute element, gushing _‘i’ve told you before and I’ll tell you again, from the top of my lungs to the tip of my pen’_, a line that **Oberst** himself would be proud of.\n\nIn an age of counterfeit songwriters (here’s looking at you **Ed Sheeran**), it’s rewarding and refreshing to hear such genuine, intelligent compositions. Acoustic driven music can often fall rather flat, but in the case of **Cavan Moran** he finds the balance between expressing personality and maintaining an admirable sense of realism. Check out _Until The End_ below.",
