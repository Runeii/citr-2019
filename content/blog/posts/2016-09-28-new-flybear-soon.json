  "body": "Back in the early 2010’s, when music blogs, chill-wave and been an apathetic student were all very much ‘in’, producers like **Flybear** were all the rage.\n\nYoung creatives with little more than a laptop and an MPC, crafting beautifully intricate compositions from the confines of their bedrooms. Several years on and whilst the sound has suffered a little due to major labels co-opting the ‘movement’ (here’s looking at you, Kygo), it appears that this innovative spirit still lives amongst many. Twenty year old producer and multi-instrumentalist Flybear is leading the sound to it’s natural progression – with his latest, _Soon…_ coming across as far more pioneering than many of his contemporaries. Lifted from his forthcoming debut EP out in November, it’s hopefully a sign of much more to come. Check out Soon… below.\n\nLike this?
