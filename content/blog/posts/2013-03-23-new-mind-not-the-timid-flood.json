  "body": "With Youth Lagoon’s new LP Wondrous Bughouse rapidly filtering into the mainstream with it’s gorgeous layers of psychedelia and unprovoked discussions of the subconscious state between life and death, it seems only inevitable that acts will begin to draw inspiration from Mr Powers.\n\nNashville outfit **Mind Not The Timid** already seem to be unknowingly picking from a similar palette of sounds, albeit from a slightly more pop skewed direction, on their new single _Flood_, taken from their forthcoming debut album **_Beacons_**. A slightly disjointed but nevertheless thoroughly enjoyable five minutes of vocal led chamber pop, complete with whistling sections and grand crescendos. Check it out below.",
