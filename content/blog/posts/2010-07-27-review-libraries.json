What makes Libraries different is that the music it is recalling were recorded in this way in the first place. There is no Burt Bacharach or Phil Spector album recorded in their bedroom.\n\nListening to hypnotic dream-like _Horophones_ or heavily layered opener _Pedals_, it is apparent that those names, particularly Spector’s, are still a clear influence on the sound of Libraries.\n\n_Heart To Tell_ echoes more of the spirit and sound of the début and is a stone-cold pop delight while _This Blood Our Own_ is an album highlight, slowly building up into a crescendo of lush guitars and glacial strings. If you come to any kind of resolution by the time this album is finished, it will be that Libraries is absolutely packed to the brim with hooks, memorable memories and songs that imprint themselves onto your after just a few spins.\n\nIt’s not all plain sailing however, _This Room_ feels more like an embarrassing pastiche and ends the album on a really weak note and Wilmont only adds to the album’s theme of sounding a bit like the first album and then suddenly switching back to their new polished sound. I feel that this is more of a transitional piece for The Love Language, an album to bridge the gap between their early tendencies and their new found discovery that clean does not necessarily equal bad.\n\n‘Brittany’s back!’ McLamb declares and so is The Love Language, just what 2010 needed.",
