Paul Murphy’s haunting vocals (a particular highlight on their stupendous 2007 album, _Welcome to the Night Sky_) are as strong as ever, as is the sort of drumming that you’d come to expect from a band founded by a percussionist. ‘In Came The Flood’ in particular is right in **Wintersleep**‘s comfort zone whilst ‘Resuscitate’ adds just a twinge of something new to their already nicely developed sound.\n\nCheck out the tracks below, and get the album on release in June – it’s bound to be a great one.",
