  "date": "2013-05-05T20:19:09",
  "body": "The sun is out, university is drawing to a close and festival season is upon us.\n\nSuddenly things don’t seem so bad. On this, his fifth original track, LA producer **Kellen Malloy** further shapes what is gradually becoming a stunning debut album. Drawing from drone and ambient works, alongside the **Radiohead** / **Thom Yorke** influences experienced on previous tracks, _Octillo III_ is ambitious and at times beautifully uncompromising. As epic as it is daunting, Kellen Malloy is rapidly becoming one of the most exciting new talents around.",
