  "body": "Not only is **Geowulf’s** debut track, _Get You_, pretty impressive in itself, she also has pretty impeccable taste in new music, having reposted the likes of Vallis Alps and Natali Felicia on her Soundcloud in recent weeks.\n\nPretty straight forward, but impeccably done indie-pop, it’s a hugely promising first outing, and hopefully a taster of more to come. Check out Get You below.",
