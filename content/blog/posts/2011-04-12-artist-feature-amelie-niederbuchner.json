She makes no reservations about this, taking photos of friends hanging by a lake or taking a trip on a boat. The colours are lush and ripe, reveling in the surroundings. Luckily there are depths to her work; some are unnerving in their picturesque qualities, creating a blissful landscape of naivety that lingers long after the image is gone. One to look out for.\n\nCheck out Amelie Niederbuchner’s [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/people/amelie-n/)",
