  "body": "I imagine that in the yearbooks of Nathalie Bruno, Jake Ambridge and Helene De Thoury, they were listed under ‘most likely to do an XX’.\n\nPHOSPHOR conjure up the same sort of trance inducing atmosphere that Jamie XX & co found fame with, morphing menacing synths into something of great beauty. New track Influx feels much like a progression from previous work, whilst serving as a form of shoegaze inspired interlude. Check it out below.",
