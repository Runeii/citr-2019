With the release of their [fantastic debut EP](https://soundcloud.com/the1975/sets/the-1975-facedown-ep-1) earlier this year, they’re now readying what will surely be their ‘breakthrough’ single; the gritty, infectious and downright adorably sleazy Sex. With it’s **Pulp** style lyricism – “_I’m not trying to stop you love, if we’re gonna do anything we might as well just fuck_“, and mid-00s indie guitar lines, **The 1975** may well just be the next big thing, that’s if they can hold onto a name for long enough.",
