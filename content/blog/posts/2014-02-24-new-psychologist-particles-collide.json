  "body": "It’s been quite a while since we last heard from **Psychologist**, aka London recording artist Iain Woods.\n\nHis stunning debut EP dropped to hugely enthusiastic reviews back in 2011, with lead track [Comes In Waves](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7s8kDzD208) being one of the highlights of the year. A few years on, and Woods is stepping back out from the shadows, with the release of new track, _When Particles Collide_. Bolder, and a fuller sound than experienced on his EP, it’s a definite progression, and is perhaps most outwardly ‘pop’ orientated, yet without losing the glossy, glistening edge that characterised his earlier material. Stream When Particles Collide below, and keep an eye out for an full LP coming later this year.",
