  "body": "The self-titled debut LP from **Hundred Waters** was one of my favourite releases of 2012, and still sits in pretty heavy rotation on my nighttime chill-out playlists.\n\nHaving spent much of the last few months recording for their sophomore record, the quartet have decided to release a teaser in the way of non-single _Down From The Rafters_, picking up where their first record left off. Sleek and almost at times almost unimaginably beautiful, it’s a very promising first step for what could well be one of the albums of 2014.",
