  "body": "Having released a sneak peak of his sophomore album in the form of _Pillow Talk_ at the tail end of February, **Lance Smith** aka **Pandit** is back with new jam _Believe Me_.\n\nPlaying to his ability to conjure up stunning, ethereal atmospheres, and his dazzling production values, Believe Me embodies truly unique and entirely personal characteristics. With several of his tracks having featured on both the US and UK versions of Skins, and his second album around the corner, 2012 is set to be very exciting for **Pandit**.\n\n<a href=\"http://pandit.bandcamp.com/album/pandit\">Pandit by Pandit</a>",
