  "body": "**Dear Anonymous** have left me torn in a despicably self-centered manner.\n\nWhilst wanting to promote new music, I also occasionally feel a sense of inner selfishness, maintaining my intimate connection with the music by keeping it entirely to myself. Anyway, having conquered my pretentious demons, I decided that Brisbane’s **Dear Anonymous** is just too good to not be heard. Drifting from melancholic piano ballads (_Only Ones_) to **Antlers**\\-esque lullaby’s (_Awkward_), the three piece comprised of **Julia Kourtidis** (piano/vocals), **Rob Knaggs** (cello) and **Ben Tilney** (guitar) are a further jewel in the constantly expanding crown that is Australia’s music scene. Check out their debut EP **_Songs For Chuck And Blair_** below.",
