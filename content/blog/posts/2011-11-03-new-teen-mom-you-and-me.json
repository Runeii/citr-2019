  "body": "Washington DC’s **[Teen Mom](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Teen-Mom-DC/191023127616953?sk=wall)** write cutesy indie pop, and their debut track _You And Me_ is a fitting introduction to the trio. A three minute twee anthem in waiting, combining the charm of **The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart** with a faint, slightly gritty edge more commonly associated with the likes of **Cloud Nothings**. Plenty of warm fuzz, oozing with heartbreak and fantastically enjoyable, as they themselves put it ‘\\[Teen Mom are\\] just a band, playing love songs.’. Here’s hoping they have plenty more up their sleeves. Check out _You And Me_ below and head over to their [bandcamp](http://teenmomdc.bandcamp.com/) for a free download.",
