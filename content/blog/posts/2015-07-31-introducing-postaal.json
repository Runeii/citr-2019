  "body": "My younger brother spent the best part of the last year living in Paris, and having taken the time to visit him back in April, it quickly became evident to me that it’s a city unlike any other.\n\nThe unparalleled history of the place co-exists alongside a remarkable vibrancy and youthfulness; it’s no wonder that so many young creatives are choosing to relocate to the French capital. **POSTAAL**, a Anglo-French duo currently residing in Paris released their debut track, _Freedom_, earlier this month, and it’s an inspired first outing. Intimate when necessary yet hinting at a grander sound to come, the stunning visuals that accompany allude to the unpredictability of youth and the longing for a sense of escape from the mundane. Check it out below, alongside a remix of CitR favourites, **Formation**.",
