Rather than booking obvious artists, the night’s founders instead try to go for up and coming DJ’s in the hope of spreading the word about the music they love. It’s this love of music that keeps the kids coming back, the atmosphere is relaxed, the drinks are cheap and the people are great. Newcastle’s dubstep scene is definitely still alive. On the 29th of April it was Sukh Knight’s turn to play Rusty Bucket Bay and he very much lived up to the reputation that precedes him, playing a varied and empowered set. However rather than telling you how great the night was we’d prefer to show you; so below is Crack In The Road TV’s first film by Jack Pearce, giving you a flavour of what Rusty Bucket Bay is all about.\n\n[Watch The Film](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOo621EctA4)\n\n[Check Out Jack Pearce’s Youtube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/jackpearcefilm)\n\n[Sukh Knight’s Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/sukhknight)\n\n[Rusty Bucket Bay’s Website](http://www.rustybucketbay.co.uk/)",
