  "body": "It feels like Brit School graduate Archy Marshal aka **King Krule** has been around for ages.\n\nWith the ink still drying on his debut album deal with illustrious label XL Recordings, and a slew of live dates that’s taken in the likes of The Great Escape and Glastonbury, the 18 year old has unveiled the debut single to be taken from his forthcoming LP. Easy Easy, lifted from **_6 Feet Beneath the Moon_**, out 24 August (coincidently, also his 19th birthday), demonstrates what we’ve come to respect from Marshall; raw, hard-hitting and socially observant. Check out _Easy Easy_ below, and pre-order his debut LP [here](http://smarturl.it/kingkrule).",
