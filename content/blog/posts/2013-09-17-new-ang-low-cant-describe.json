  "body": "Exploding onto the blog scene three months ago with his debut single [_Life Goes Down_](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/22566-introducing-ang-low/), Brooklyn’s **ANG LOW** is back with another slice of affecting R&B. _Can’t Describe Her_ is as expertly produced as his debut, but ramping up the pace where it matters, sort of like an ADHD version of The Weeknd. Check out Can’t Describe Her below, and grab a free download from his [Bandcamp](http://anglow.bandcamp.com/).",
