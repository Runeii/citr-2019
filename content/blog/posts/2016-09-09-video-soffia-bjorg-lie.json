  "date": "2016-09-09T07:58:14",
  "body": "Absolutely love this video from Icelandic newcomer **Soffía Björg**, mimicking the style of 60’s US TV performances from the likes of The Beatles and Elvis, most notably on The Ed Sullivan show.\n\n Whilst the track itself feels rooted amongst folk music, there’s an almost Angel Olsen-esque quality to the energy injected into it, making for a far more rousing spectacle. Check it out below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
