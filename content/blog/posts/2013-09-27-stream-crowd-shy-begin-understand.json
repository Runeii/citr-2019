  "body": "A musical mirage of sorts, **Crowd Shy** appeared seemingly out of nowhere a couple of months back, and merges a plethora of modern electronic influences on his debut LP.\n\nListening through _**Begin To Understand**_, and you start to pick out elements of early 00’s R&B (_Tomorrow Will Be Different_), ’09 chillwave (_Can’t Take It_) and the very up to date M83 meets Washed Out vibe of _Let This Happen_. Without any label or PR backing, it’s sadly inevitable that Crowd Shy’s music hasn’t reached the number of people that it’s quality suggests it should have done, however don’t let that take anything away from what is a thoroughly enjoyable record. Check out **_Begin To Understand_** below and keep up with Crowd Shy over at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/crowdshy).",
