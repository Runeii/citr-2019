  "body": "This kid is fifteen.\n\nWow, doesn’t that make you feel old? Straight out of Toronto, **Ryan Dela Cruz** aka **Hollow Pigeons** is creating some of the finest chillout music around at the moment. New EP, **_Birthdays_** is an eclectic mix of borrowed samples and blissed out melodies, forming a release that leaves a craving for repeated listens. Take **More Affection**, a jittery **Evenings** inspired number, washing luxuriously over the listener, before dropping a **Baths** (_Seaside Town_ – originally taken from Kiki’s Delivery Service) sample into the track. Or there’s the spellbinding 1996 (presumably the year of **Dela Cruz’s** birth), which gradually builds up minimal inspired layers into a gorgeous cacophony of **Balam Acab**\\-esque sounds. With **Hollow Pigeons** still in his mid-teens, you can guarantee that this won’t be the last we hear from him.\n\nCheck out a couple of choice picks from _Birthdays_ below, and head over to his [bandcamp](http://hollowpigeons.bandcamp.com/) to grab the rest of the release for free.\n\n [More Affection](http://soundcloud.com/hollowpigeons/more-affection) by [Hollow Pigeons](http://soundcloud.com/hollowpigeons)\n\n<a href=\"http://hollowpigeons.bandcamp.com/track/1996\">1996 by Hollow Pigeons</a>\n\n[Follow @joshdaltonn](https://twitter.com/joshdaltonn)  \n  \n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share)",
