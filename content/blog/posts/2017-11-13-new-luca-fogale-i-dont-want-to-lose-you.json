  "body": "Really loved **Luca Fogale’s** album from last year, showcasing his stunning voice and knack for finding a killer hook.\n\nReturning with his first new material of 2017, _I Don’t Want To Lose You_ is another slice of emotionally fraught songwriting genius; perhaps more obviously commercially orientated than anything on his debut LP, it’s no less affecting. Give this track to a Sam Smith or a John Legend and you’ve got a hit on your hands. Check it out below.",
