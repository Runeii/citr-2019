For twenty-five pounds a year, readers will gain access to exclusive tracks, cheaper gig tickets and discounts at their online store, as well as four copies of the publication each year. It’s an interesting concept, with the Welsh band clearly realising that music sales are continually on the decrease, thus Heat Rash provides more of an incentive, and a slight diversion from the norm for avid fans.\n\nTo wet our appetite, the group have decided to allow the free download of the first track from the magazine, the festively themed Kindle A Flame In Her Heart. As usual, Los Campesinos! provide their own unique twist to this Christmas number, it’s twee lyrics and honest, cutting delivery, are far from the stereotypical festive tune. It’s intent is admirable, but it’s ultimately a slight disappointment after the fantastic Romance Is Boring, released earlier this year. Kindle A Flame In Her Heart is available to stream and download below.\n\n[Kindle A Flame In Her Heart](http://soundcloud.com/los-campesinos/kindle-a-flame-in-her-heart) by [Los Campesinos!](http://soundcloud.com/los-campesinos)",
