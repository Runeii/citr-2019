I suppose mash-up Mixtapes of any kind are meant to, by their very nature, provoke a tilt of the head and a raised eyebrow. This ‘James Drake’ Mixtape is no exception; the initial reaction however holds no weight after the first 5 seconds. The record is tender, full of longing and at times lust; it gels together to form a series of moments that sound like two men discussing various failed love affairs, on the boundary of the dream and a nightmare. If my description isn’t too amateurishly poetic for your taste, check the Mixtape out below.\n\n[James Drake Mixtape – Bombé & Mr. Caribbean](http://soundcloud.com/tropicalbombe/james-drake-mixtape-bombe-mr-caribbean) by [Bombé](http://soundcloud.com/tropicalbombe)",
