  "body": "The unusual, but ideal pairing of New Jersey’s **John Robinson** and London’s **Lewis Parker** have come together to create a new summer LP, fittingly titled **International Summers**.\n\nKnown for his acclaimed ‘Golden Sound’ Lewis Parker’s productions have a distinctly warm and cosmopolitan feel to them, while John Robinson rhymes are always tight if not slightly repetitive as he recites memories of globe-trotting and past summers. The pairing shine in feel good title track **International Summers**, with John Robinson declaring “_International summers make international lovers_” over a delightfully nostalgic beat. The other stand out track is the lyrically deep and beautifully produced **Harlem River Drive**, where the pairing prove most in sync as they are joined by the excellent **Angelz INC**.\n\nToo cut short and summarise, **International Summers** is not a particularly ground-braking or innovative record, but**Lewis Parker’s** warm analogue production and **John Robinson’s** interesting and immaculately delivered lyrics make it the perfect album to listen to on a hot summers evening or during a long day travelling.\n\n8/10\n\n[Album Preview.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKpV_NR9BSE&feature=player_embedded)\n\n[Pre-order.](http://www.hhv.de/item_202343.html) (Includes free tape with all album instrumentals)\n\n[More Info.](http://www.projectmooncircle.com/releases/67)[](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/1662-john-robinson-lewis-parker-international-summers/attachment/image)",
