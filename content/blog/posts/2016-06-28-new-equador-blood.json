  "body": "There’s a gorgeous, almost Portishead-esque atmosphere that encircles this lush debut track from **Equador** (Zero 7’s Henry Binns, singer / songwriter Bo Bruce and Jodi Miliner).\n\nExtravagant yet somehow admirably intimate, Blood comes with rather imposing, intimidating visuals – it’s the sort of track that demands repeat listens and longs to be fully realised in a live setting. Check out _Blood_ below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
