  "date": "2017-09-13T19:15:43",
  "body": "Two blissful new tracks from Utah’s **Child Ivory**, one of my favourite new discoveries of the year.\n\nRhetoric especially is refreshingly honest as a track, seamlessly merging some classically influenced songwriting with a very 80’s-esque production style, it still manages to come across as truly authentic and natural. Accompanied by a brilliant video shot in Taiwan with local actors, there’s elements of everyone from Phil Collins to M83 to Rhetoric. Check it out below alongside their other recent single, Angie.",
