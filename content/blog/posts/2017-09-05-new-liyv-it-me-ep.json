  "date": "2017-09-05T16:25:31",
  "body": "**Liyv** released a whole host of tracks over the course of the past eighteen months or so that showcased colossal potential.\n\nHer unique take on ‘sad songs for people who like bright colors’ is startlingly refreshing in an age where personality at the core of pop songwriting seems to have all but disappeared. Moments like You’re Not Going to Ruin My Life and Splintered Arms really pack a punch, while being thoroughly colourful.\n\nHer newest release, a six track EP titled It Me feels like a bold, more confident step forward into commercially friendly pop music. Tracks like _Throwing Gold_ and _Weeknight_ have an almost Carly Rae Jepsen quality to them; bubblegum pop yet still scintillatingly cool. Check out both below, and the full EP on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3WRQTNIiTT3RVlToBYu4pY).",
