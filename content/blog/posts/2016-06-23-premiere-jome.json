  "body": "**JOME’s** two mesmerising tracks so far, Cinnamon and Brushstroke, quite rightly won him plenty of fans amongst the tastemaker community.\n\nDeeply affecting and intricately composed, there’s a tenderness to the LA songwriters’ music that is rarely found, merging elements of the likes of SOHN, Daughter and Bon Iver. His newest offering, _Good Love_, is another slice of heart-string tugging pop, perfectly polished and potentially even hinting at an even grander, more anthemic sound to come. Early days still, but it’s safe to say that JOME has already made quite the impression in 2016. Check it out below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
