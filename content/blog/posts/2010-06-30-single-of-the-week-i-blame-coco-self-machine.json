Fear not however as “Self Machine” Coco’s major label debut and the record prescribed by both the label and the modern music hype machine to be “The Hit” is a fine piece of modern vibrant electro pop.\n\nBoasting a distinctive voice and a keen ear for a memorable hook “Self Machine” fulfils its duty as a summer pop hit and promises that Coco Sumner’s career can take on an infinitely more interesting path than that or her more famous father.\n\n[httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6VoW6vv9Y&feature=related](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6VoW6vv9Y&feature=related)",
