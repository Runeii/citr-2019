  "body": "What feels like a decade of waiting, Mancunian odd-pop outfit **Egyptian Hip Hop** have finally released their debut LP, _**Good Don’t Sleep**_ out 22 October on R&S Records.\n\nFeaturing the previously heard tracks _Yoro Diallo_ and _SYH_, it’s unique in the fact that they’ve ditched all of the material that made up their debut EP; a bold and admirable move. Check out the full stream of the album below. ([Via NME](http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=15&p=12871&title=egyptian_hip_hop_good_don_t_sleep_exclus&more=1&c=1))",
