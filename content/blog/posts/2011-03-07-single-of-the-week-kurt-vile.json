  "body": "![](http://www.knoxroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/kurtvile.jpg \"KV\")\n\nTaken from Kurt Vile’s fantastic new record, Smoke Ring For My Halo released today, Jesus Fever is one of the many highlights. Showcasing a far more mature sound that experienced on previous releases, Jesus Fever is smoothly refined and produced, whilst not detracting from Vile’s narrative lyrics. With this, his fourth full length release, Vile is beginning to draw the sort of plaudits that he deserves, gaining a best new music tag on pitchfork this morning and scoring numerous top album marks. Listen to Jesus Fever below.\n\n [Kurt Vile – Jesus Fever](http://soundcloud.com/pretty-much-amazing/kurt-vile-jesus-fever) by [Pretty Much Amazing](http://soundcloud.com/pretty-much-amazing)",
