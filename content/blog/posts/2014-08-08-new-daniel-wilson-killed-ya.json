  "date": "2014-08-08T18:27:05",
  "body": "**Daniel Wilson** is one of my favourite voices in music right now.\n\nHis **_Young Rubbish_** EP released earlier this year is one of the most diverse compositions of 2014, and latest track, _Killed Ya_, sees him mixing up his sound again, going for a hypnotising hybrid of soul meets 90’s disco, and to be honest, completely nailing it. I could just as easily imagine Amy Winehouse singing this, as could Pharrell. Check out Killed Ya below, lifted from an EP out later in September.",
