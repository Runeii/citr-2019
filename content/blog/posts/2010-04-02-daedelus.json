  "body": "L.\n\nA. electronic musician Daedelus recently released his new EP, entitled _Righteous_ _Fists Of Harmony._ It is presented as a soundtrack to the failed Chinese resistance (Righteous Fists Of Harmony) against western forces at the turn of the 20th century. If you are already a fan of daedelus, you may know of his ability to create a warm and dense atmosphere, and that is very noticeable throughout the piece. This is a slow paced EP that drifts you from one track to another seamlessly in a wash of strings, harp and carefully thought out electronic noise. Daedelus also includes his wife Laura Darlington, Amir Yaghmai and  Kid A  all on vocals, all of whom compliment the music delightfully.\n\nThis EP is a must for anyone who liked his album _Denies The Day’s Demise_and anyone who is interested in atmospheric music. The EP is out now on Flying Lotus’ label Brainfeeder and is available on 12″ Vinyl, mp3 or FLAC formats.\n\n[Buy. (12″)](http://www.normanrecords.com/records/114613) [Buy.
