  "body": "2014 was great year for music and **Duly Noted Records** were at the forefront, bringing us some truly special artists.\n\nOne of my personal favourites, **The Night VI** have propelled into the new year with new track _Too Late To Lie_ and it’s absolutely fantastic. Less synthetic than their previous efforts, the track is hauntingly beautiful, its organic backbone topped off with pained vocals that conjure lost love and desperation. The track also comes with the announcement of their new E.P penned for September 29th. It’s a long wait, but I’m pretty sure it’s gonna be worth it. Listen below.",
