And all this because of a simple yet eye wateringly beautiful video that dropped on YouTube those few months ago. A few hours ago Lana dropped her new video for the B-side, **_Blue Jeans_**. It’s a similar affair; borrowed vintage footage surrounding striking, dramatic yet personal shorts of Lana. Despite the repeated style, it still manages to tell a heart-breaking story. At times it’s goofy, the video’s voice tracks sometimes jumps into the music, the effect oscillating from the sublime to the ridiculous. Regardless, it’s brave, honest and mesmerising; just like Lana herself.\n\n**_Video Games_** is released on October 7th, stream the new video below.",
