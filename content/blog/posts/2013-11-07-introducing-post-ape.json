  "body": "I’m slightly ashamed that it’s taken me this long to write about **Post-Ape**.\n\nHis debut track, _Limbs In The Dark_, was a sort of twisted, LCD Soundsystem meets Nick Cave masterpiece, complete with the quite disconcerting video. New cut, _The World Is Over_, shows a marked progression, and comes across as a far more confident step forward, mixing his pop-sensibilities with a Matt Bellamy-esque vocal and lyricism. Check out the new track below, and the video for Limbs In The Dark underneath that.",
