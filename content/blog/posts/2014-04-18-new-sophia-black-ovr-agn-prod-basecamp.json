  "date": "2014-04-18T00:00:36",
  "body": "I caught a few tracks from **BASECAMP** at SXSW this year, and they were awesome, despite playing on the worst stage set-up of the entire festival (Red Eyed Fly).\n\nWith 2013’s self titled EP still on heavy rotation, and their fanbase growing day by day, the trio have leant a hand to LA newcomer **Sophia Black** and her sumptuous new track, _OVR AGN_. Utilising her fantastic vocals, and their own production prowess, it’s a worthy follow up to her debut track, [Kissing](https://soundcloud.com/sophiablack/kissing). Stream it below.",
