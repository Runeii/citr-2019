  "body": "I stumbled across Brooklyn’s **Gospels** several months back whilst trying to find the Facebook page for a band with the [same name](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14347-introducing-gospels/) (who’ve coincidentally disappeared since). Whilst I didn’t have time then to put anything in words on the four piece rap collective comprised of **Tecs**, **Sony**, **2EZ** and **I.D.**, I bookmarked their music for future reference, and boy am I glad I did. These two new tracks from **Tecs** and **2EZ** are their slickest outings to date, perfecting the underground trap sound whilst showcasing the lyrical proficiency of both artists. There’s whiffs of early 90’s NY, most notably **Organized Konfusion**, mainly through the crescendo’s of each verse and intelligent production values. Check out _Sapphire Oceans_ and _Alcatrazphronies_ below.",
