  "body": "**Pumarosa** have kicked up quite a fuss over the past eighteen months or so, despite only having a couple of tracks to their name, it’s been their live shows that have really put them on the lips of numerous tastemakers.\n\nTheir third offering, _Honey_, which also comes with a b-side demo of new track Sinking Heart, is another epic, Sonic Youth inspired number, managing to come across as suitable for raucous, intimate house shows, as it would be for the larger venues that they’ll no doubt occupy soon.
