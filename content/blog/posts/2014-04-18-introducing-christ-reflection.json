I do not hold a valid driving license, and I’m not high, so it’s hard. Their _**Journey to Realville**_  is the impossible combustion of blast-off (_i_), righteous full-steam cruise (_ii_), the click of jets warming down (_iii_). Edge-of-oblivion stuff, propelled screaming into the future with all the Atlas-borne weight of its heritage. Bass is dialed in white-hot while vocals are kept to a minimum, guitars drift and burst in clouds of screaming shrapnel. You’ll know who _**Journey to Realville**_ sounds like, without ever knowing who it reminds you of. It is, in short, real, _real _good shit.",
