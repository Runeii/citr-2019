  "body": "Undoubtedly one of my highlights of SXSW was getting to see **GEMS** play and spend time with them.\n\nNot only are they really great guys, but they’re also one of the most assured and majestic live acts I’ve seen this side of ’13. New track _Sinking Stone_ is possibly their most ambitious work so far, merging the shoegaze and dream pop influences that were so prominent on previous releases, with a slick, R&B tinge. Over halfway through 2013, and I’m still to find a new band that I’m as head over heels in love with as **GEMS**. Check out _Sinking Stone_ below, as well as a handful of East Coast tour dates later this month.\n\n20 July – Philadelphia – Johnny Brenda’s\\*\n\n22 July – Washington, DC – Black Cat Backstage\\*\n\n23 July – Allston, MA – Great Scott\\*\n\n25 July – New York, NY – Pianos\n\n\\* = with Indians",
