  "body": "Watching James Blake’s musical career transpire has been thoroughly exciting to watch.\n\nGoing from lonely bedroom student producer to something of a modern day musical genius in such a minute space of time must come with shortcomings, however all seem to be avoiding Blake.\n\nIf anything he’s more inspiring and experimental then ever. His latest single ‘Limit to your lover’ displays this creative confidence in its full glory. It’s audacious in its appropriation, gloriously atmospheric in its delivery and more importantly it’s our single of the week.\n\n[Buy the single on itunes](http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/limit-to-your-love-single/id403584809?affId=1311764)",
