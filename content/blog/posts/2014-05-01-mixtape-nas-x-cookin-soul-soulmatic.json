  "title": "Mixtape: Nas x Cookin Soul – Soulmatic",
  "date": "2014-05-01T16:09:51",
  "body": "Nas’ Illmatic is now over 20 years old and, in that time, it has unarguably become one of the greatest rap albums.\n\nCookin Soul, the Spanish production duo, has taken a spin at remixing this classic. Where this excels is that it only provides four actual remixes of tracks, with the rest of the music being constructed from snippets recorded at the time Illmatic was made.\n\nThe raw rhymes on the original album are present, but they are now backed with soul and funk samples, giving the project a more upbeat feel. You can listen and download Soulmatic below. I guarantee it’ll put a smile on your face.",
