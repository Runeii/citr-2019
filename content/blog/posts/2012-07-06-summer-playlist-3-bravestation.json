At this point, you’re better off just listening to this playlist, closing your eyes, and going to your happy place.\n\nThis ‘summer’ playlist comes from our good Canadian pals **Bravestation**, whose debut album _Giants & Dreamers_ – and this even makes this article worth publishing – is only days away from release, and can be streamed in full over on their [Soundcloud page.](http://soundcloud.com/bravestation/sets/giants-dreamers/s-19poE) It’s really good.\n\nAnyway, enjoy the playlist and enjoy **Bravestation**‘s album. By the end of August we will have given you a summer playlist on a day when it actually feels like summer. Promise.\n\n(The list also includes **Classixx**‘s ‘Fingerpaint-Lunar’, which isn’t available on Spotify, but is up on Soundcloud [here](http://soundcloud.com/classixx/fingerpaint-lunar))\n\n**UPDATE**: It’s been brought to our attention that our American and Canadian friends can’t access Spotify. The list is published below, in handy YouTube and Soundcloud form.\n\n[**Wild Beasts** – ‘Loop the Loop’](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r07We_E355g)\n\n[**Kendrick Lamar** – ‘Rigamortis’](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBvngg87998)\n\n[**Classixx** – ‘Fingerpaint-Lunar’](http://soundcloud.com/classixx/fingerpaint-lunar)\n\n[**Moon Boots** – ‘Got Somebody’](http://soundcloud.com/frenchexpress/moon-boots-got-somebody)\n\n[**Alt-J** – ‘Dissolve Me’](http://soundcloud.com/alt-j/07-dissolve-me)\n\n[**Saint Motel** – ‘1997’](http://soundcloud.com/saintmotel/saint-motel-1997)\n\n[**A$AP Rocky** – ‘Goldie’](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLCf-URqIf0)\n\n[**CANT** – ‘Believe’](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KhdPS7-MEw)\n\n[**Yeasayer** – ‘Henrietta’](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo4rbhR_vsk)\n\n[**Usher** – ‘Climax’](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIHzh5w4tUc)\n\n[**Paul Simon** – ‘Graceland’](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KL8qf2qG6c)",
