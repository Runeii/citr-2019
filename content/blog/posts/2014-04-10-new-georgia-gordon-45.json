  "body": "I’ve been keeping an eye on Edinburgh’s **Georgia Gordon** for a while now and her latest track, _45_, really steps it up a notch.\n\nWith a four track EP released on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/never-seen-the-sun-ep/id797550775) earlier this year, she’s put up 45 / Neither Do I on a [Bandcamp](http://georgiagordon.bandcamp.com/) page, with the A-side proving one of the most elegantly delicate compositions of the year thus far. Not usually my style of music, there’s an intimacy to Gordon’s voice, and lyrics that really takes it to the next level. Check it out below.",
