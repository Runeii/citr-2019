The characters in the video change from Taylor Swift, her boyfriend and their annoying mates, in to China, the Soviet Union, Germany and Great Britain. The teenagers’ lovers tiffs turns in to political conflict. Why didn’t you call Workers Party of Korea? I thought we were on a break Hungary? I thought I was your one and only Romania?\n\nI also think there’s also an air about it of pointing out that the song and Swift are, unfortunately, far more well known across the world and a much vaster number of people will know her lyrics, as opposed to different countries’ foreign policies, political alliances, differences and histories.\n\nBut maybe that’s reading a bit much in to it – it might just be a really funny, and a bit silly video. After all, when we attended the installation, we were forced to wear cut-out masks of Lenin, Che Guevara and Chairman Mao…\n\nAt any rate, Taylor Swift is a dick and her music is terrible, so even if it fails to hit the mark with its more serious message, the video installation was enjoyable nonetheless.\n\n#gallery-1 { margin: auto; } #gallery-1 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } #gallery-1 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-1 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } /\\* see gallery\\_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php \\*/\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Ruidi-Mu-150x150.png)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22809-artist-profile-ruidi-mu/attachment/ruidi-mu)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Ruidi-Mu-handout-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22809-artist-profile-ruidi-mu/attachment/ruidi-mu-handout)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Ruidi-Mu-handout-2-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22809-artist-profile-ruidi-mu/attachment/ruidi-mu-handout-2)\n\n  \n\n[www.ruidimu.com](http://www.ruidimu.com/)",
