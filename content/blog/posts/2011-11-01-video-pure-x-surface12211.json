  "body": "One of this years unexpected pleasures, Texas’s **Pure X** wowed fans and critics alike with their debut album, _**Pleasure**_.\n\nA brash and distorted experience, drawing hugely from late 80’s shoegaze with touches of grittier, lo-fi indie, it’s already a dead-cert amongst many ‘Best Of 11’ lists. Earlier today the trio made a video available for one of the album’s highlights; the atmospheric, ecstasy trip _Surface_. The video echoes the eerily disturbed feeling of the track, showing what appears to be somewhere between an overtly sexualised fight and a violently psychotic party. Check out the video for _Surface_ below, directed by [Malcom Elijah](malcolmelijah.com).\n\n[Pure X – “Surface”](http://vimeo.com/31354239) from [Malcolm Elijah](http://vimeo.com/malcolmelijah) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
