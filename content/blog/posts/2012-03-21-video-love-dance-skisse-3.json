  "body": "There’s something oddly beautiful about the coast.\n\nThe feeling of starring out towards a vast expanse of stunning nothingness can’t be matched; it’s freedom with unlimited potential or consequence. This new video from Norway dream-pop group **Love Dance** exploits this emotion through hazy shots of idyllic cliffs and crashing waves, almost as if envisioning an alternate reality. _Skisse #3_ is a shoegaze inspired number, drawing comparisons to the likes of **Ride** and **Pale Saints**, yet with a modern pop twist. Check it out below.\n\n[Love Dance – Skisse #3](http://vimeo.com/38683597) from [IncreaseThePeace](http://vimeo.com/increasethepeace) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
