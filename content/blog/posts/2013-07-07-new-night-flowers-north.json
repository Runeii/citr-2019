  "body": "Since impressing with their debut release little over a year ago, London outfit **Night Flowers** have taken some time off to refine their sound, and have returned with new single _Single Beds / North_.\n\nIt’s early 90’s dream-pop at utmost languid and intoxicating, not quite heavy enough to filter into the shoegaze category, and not quite twisted enough to seep into Cocteau Twins territory. Kick your shoes off, turn it up loud, and enjoy. Check out _North_ below.",
