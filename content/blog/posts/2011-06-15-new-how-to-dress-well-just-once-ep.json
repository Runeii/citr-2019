The record features entirely new takes on _Love remains_’ “_Suicide Dream 1_“, “_Suicide Dream 2_“, and “_Decisions_“, as well as a new song, “_Suicide Dream 3_“. As expected the EP is an enchanting and moving re-imagining of the songs. One dollar from the sale of each 10” will be donated to the mental health organization [MindFreedom.org](http://mindfreedom.org/), and will be released on June 21.
