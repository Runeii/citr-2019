  "body": "Long time CitR favourites **NO** are set to release their highly anticipated debut album, _**El Prado**_ via Arts & Crafts on 18 February, and have preceded the LP with lead single _Leave The Door Wide Open_.\n\nAlso the opening track of the record, it’s rather fitting that the ever powerful vocals of frontman Bradley Hanan Carter begin the track, with their somber, dulcet tones. Immediately anthemic, it’s a staple part of their fiery live shows; just waiting to be introduced to the festival circuit.",
