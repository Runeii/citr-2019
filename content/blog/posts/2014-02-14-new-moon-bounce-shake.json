  "date": "2014-02-14T21:48:59",
  "body": "It’s been a while since we last posted anything from Philadelphia’s **Moon Bounce**.\n\nWith a new EP on the way and an even slicker, funkier direction as shown on new track _Shake_, 2014 is shaping up rather nicely. Immaculate production mixes coherently with his slick vocals, and choppy beats, sliding in somewhere between the host of Dilla inspired musicians that appear to be dominating music websites right now, and the next generation of blog-graduate popstars, e.g. Ben Khan and Abhi Dijon and co. Check out the fantastic Shake below, and keep your eyes peeled for his **_Dress Rehearsal_** EP, out 25 February.",
