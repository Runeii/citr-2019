Scout Larue)\")**’s surprisingly upbeat, almost tropical new jam. I’d like to make it clear that there’s no way I would have spotted that if **Pitchfork** hadn’t noticed it earlier today, I guess there is a benefit to **P4K** premiering EVERYTHING first. Anyway, as it’s Black Friday it becomes a clear assault on the most odious day of the year. Away from that, we’re left with a vibrating, syncopated, synth-laden and ultimately fun little jam. Enjoy.",
