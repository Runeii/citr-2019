  "body": "It’s been a while since I’ve heard a debut track instilled with this much confidence.\n\n**HUNTAR’s** _Expectations_ relies in part on the stunning vocals of the, for now, anonymous musician, building layers beautifully, culminating in an expansive, over the top finale. Attempting to pigeonhole or tie **HUNTAR** down to a specific sound or even contemporaries would be rather foolish at this moment in time, with this debut number combining elements of genres from all across the board, and in doing so, sculpting a track that’s as magnificent as it is intriguing.",
