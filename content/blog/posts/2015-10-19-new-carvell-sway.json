  "body": "Beginning brightly, Carvell’s debut effort ‘Sway’ ventures its way through a fine blend of classic indie guitar lines and a strong vocal delivery.\n\nThere is a lot about ‘Sway’ that feels anthemic, particularly the verses with echoed vocal lines, though in another turn it is these verses that offer other elements of interesting production and arrangement which elevate it much beyond a simple indie track.\n\nThere is very little online about Carvell at the moment, but you can check our ‘Sway’ in the meantime below.",
