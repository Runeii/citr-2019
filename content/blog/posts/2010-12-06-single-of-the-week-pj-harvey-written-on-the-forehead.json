  "body": "![](file:///Users/MacAdminLocalHome/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/moz-screenshot.jpg) ![](file:///Users/MacAdminLocalHome/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/moz-screenshot-1.jpg)\n\nIt’s been fairly quiet at **Crack in the Road** recently, which is something we can only apologise for. In our period of absence however the world of music has carried on regardless. **PJ Harvey’s** imminent re-arrival to the British music scene is perhaps the most exciting news from the last week, with the slow release of new material making the launch of her newest record _‘Let Britain Shake’_ all the more tantalising. _Written on the forehead_ is the latest tune brought to the public domain and brings with it a brave new direction for **Harvey**. The rage is still very much there, at least in spirit, but it seems that the passion that was once there has found a new way to be expressed. What we have instead is a swirling, visceral and soothing take on the end of the world. _“People throw belongings and lifetime’s earnings amongst the scattered rubbish, suitcases on the sidewalk.”_ It’s almost calming in its existential delight towards the apocalypse. If the whole of _‘Let Britain Shake’_ is as fascinating as this, we could be in for a treat. Have a great week.
