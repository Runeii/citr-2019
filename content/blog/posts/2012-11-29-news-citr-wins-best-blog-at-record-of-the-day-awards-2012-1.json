  "body": "Without blowing our own trumpet, we’re stoked to announce that last night_** Crack in the Road**_ won ‘Best Blog’ at the annual Record of the Day Awards.\n\nIt’s truly an honour to be recognised alongside the likes of [Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com/), [The 405](http://thefourohfive.com/) and [The Line of Best Fit](http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/), as well as a host of fantastic journalists, publications and PR firms.\n\nAt the risk of sounding self-indulgent, it feels great to be recognised for the hard work we all put in, and more importantly, for the passion that we attempt to inject into the blog. The thought that anyone besides my mum and a few close friends read these ramblings is rather humbling, and slightly bizarre. Hopefully this award will provide increased exposure to the brilliant acts that we feature on these pages. Thank you so much for your votes and continued support, we hope you’ll continue with us on this journey. Remember, keep the love for the music.\n\nCheck out the full list of winners below.
