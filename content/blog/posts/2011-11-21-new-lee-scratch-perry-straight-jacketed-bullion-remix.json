  "body": "As soon as **Lee Perry** is even mentioned, you know this shit’s gonna be all-over-the-place crazy.\n\nI would’ve thought the sensible stylings of **Bullion** would pull it all together, but judging by the loopy track name, this remix was always going to be very much in the same vein as Mr. Perry’s original.\n\n**Bullion** plays around with textures and patterning – tribal rhythms and foreign synths clambering about clashing vocal samples and the kinds of twists a producer like him wouldn’t usually take. This is great stuff – most beat-makers go a jazzy route with experimentation, here it’s very much African, with tinges of reggae…and yodelling? What I love most about this is that it’s not going anywhere. I shouldn’t say too much, else I’d ruin the surprise…\n\n_Listen to Bullion’s remix of Straight Jacketed below. You can buy it as part of the Lee Scratch Perry remix compilation ‘Nu Sound & Version’ on On-U Sound, also featuring remixes by Kode9, DMZ, Roots Manuva and Horsepower Productions._",
