So it seems aptly fitting now to credit him with our single of the week. _Castles In The Snow_ taken from **Twin Shadow’s** debut record _Forget_, is as much a brilliant pop song as it is an abstract observational confession. Full of hauntingly majestic imagery, it clings to the brain after the first listen, with little blemishes of S**hadow’s** past being fully realised in front of us. One to watch, if you weren’t already. Have a great week.
