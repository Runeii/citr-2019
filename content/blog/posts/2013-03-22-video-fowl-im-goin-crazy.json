  "body": "httpv://www.\n\nyoutube.com/watch?v=upeZRL3mRYo\n\nDetroit’s FowL put out the video for ‘I’m Goin Crazy’ yesterday. The twenty year old rapper won the Red Bull Emcee Battle in 2010 and has released five mixtapes, all of which can be downloaded [here](http://fowlstyle.com/#projects).\n\nHis latest track has a laid back and minimalist feel to it. Over the slow-burning beat, FowL varies his delivery and performs with conviction. The video itself is less successful, as it has moments of style, but, generally, it’s pretty unremarkable. Still, there is no denying the potential FowL displays and he is definitely one to keep an eye on in the future.",
