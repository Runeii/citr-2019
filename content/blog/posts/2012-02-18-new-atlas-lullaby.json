  "body": "London trip hop duo **ATLAS** ooze sex from every pore, with new track _Lullaby_ demonstrating this sublimely, as it’s intertwines intricately throughout it’s six and a half minutes.\n\nThe instrumental sections are kept to a bare minimum, with a wooden sounding percussion section leading the track before collapsing in on itself around the four minute mark, into a deliriously wonderful mesh of disjointed beats. As with her two debut tracks, _Lullaby_ showcases **ATLAS’s** vocals to exalted effect, as she flirts between spoken word and silky smooth chorus parts; “Your time is nigh, soon you will find, Another heart to crucify”.",
