  "body": "One of my favourite artists of recent years, **Elite Gymnastics**, have sadly just announced that they’re now ‘a defunct project’, however **James Brooks**, the mastermind behind the EG, has revealed his new project, the controversially titled **Dead Girlfriends** (artwork by **Grimes**).\n\nAnnouncing the project with a four track EP, it’s a cross between the elegant, synth heavy weirdness of EG, and a rawer, but no less beautiful, dip into the poetic honesty of **Casiotone For The Painfully Alone**. Whether it’s the lush instrumental of _omertá_ or the cutting, cynicism of _stop pretending_, there’s more than enough in Dead Girlfriends to show that Brooks has far from drained of his creative talents. Check out the _stop pretending_ EP below, including the best every use of the lyric ‘ugh’.\n\nyou say you can’t be soft if you wanna be punk\n\nfine, cool, whatever, thanks for clearing that up",
