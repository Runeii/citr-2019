  "body": "Seattle duo **NAVVI** have been improving with every track that they release.\n\nFrom their initial debut offerings little over a year ago, in the form of No Lights and Weekends, to the recently released Speak (through Kitsuné), they sound fuller and more confident with each track that they treat us to. Newest outing, _Perfect Speed_, is a gorgeously layered Cocteau Twins-esque number, as elegant and delightfully poised as their press images make out. Check it out below.",
