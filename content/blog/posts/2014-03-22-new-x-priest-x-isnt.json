  "date": "2014-03-22T01:01:52",
  "body": "Florida outfit **X Priest X** (Madeline Priest and David Kazyk) are part of a rather wonderful scene cropping up in Florida right now.\n\nNew single, _Isn’t It So_, set to be released through Emotion, is their most ambitious to date, trumping their blog-hit _Samurai_. Cleaner, more refined, yet equally as bubble-gum sweet, X Priest X are all set for the big time, and Isn’t It So may well be the track to help give them that push. Check it out below, and keep your eyes out for the full EP, out 15 April.",
