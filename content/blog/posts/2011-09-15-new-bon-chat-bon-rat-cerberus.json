  "body": "**_Cerberus_** is the first track to be released from **[Bon Chat, Bon Rat’s](http://bonchatbonrat.bandcamp.com/)** debut LP, a Sydney based group who have been causing quite a stir recently. The track is a bold introduction to those who previously hadn’t heard of the group. It centers on a simple synth riff, it’s this simplicity that allows the beauty of the track to unfold. Spaced out and weightless vocals offer surreal observations of the world, _“**your skin spits whispers, a stream of dead distance**”_, while gentle chimes combine with confident yet undoubtedly micro produced beats, resulting in a full and expansive sound.\n\nWith the group hoping to release a track a month in the lead up the record launch, you’ll be hearing a lot more from **[Bon Chat, Bon Rat](http://www.facebook.com/bonchatbonrat)** on CITR.",
