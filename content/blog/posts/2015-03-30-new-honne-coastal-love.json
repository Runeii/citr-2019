  "body": "UK duo **Honne** have recently released an addictive new track teasing their new EP, which is set to be released on May 4th via Tatemae Recordings, the duo’s own imprint.\n\nIn no coincidence, ‘Honne’ and ‘Tatemae’ are two Japanese words that refer to the contrast between true feelings (honne) and the public persona (tatemae). Honne continue their carefully constructed, late night electronic ballads with _Coastal Love_, which is infused with simple yet heartfelt lyricism over a dreamy landscape that, as Honne articulates, transcends borders with its pure intent and beats both deliberate and delicate.",
