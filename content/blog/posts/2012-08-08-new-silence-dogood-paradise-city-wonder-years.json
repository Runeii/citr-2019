  "body": "I’m not quite sure why I’m so in love with **Silence Dogood**.\n\nTheir sound is a bizarre hybrid of 90’s scuzzy grunge and mid-00’s pop, yet somehow it works perfectly. With recent EP _**The Sound Of Silence**_ proving one of my favourite releases of 2012 thus far, and new two track single _Detox_ further building on their disjointed, angst driven attitude. Penning lyrics with an insight that only disillusioned adolescents can do – _“And the nightlife is great / But all of the drinks taste like rape / Drunken muscle-head fights / College kids are always right”_, it’s 50% tongue in cheek, 50% a kick in the balls to big business controlled capitalism, and it’s never sounded so good.",
