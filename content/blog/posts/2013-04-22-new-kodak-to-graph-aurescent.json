  "body": "Florida’s **Kodak To Graph** has embarked upon one of the most ambitious projects of the year, in attempting to release a track each month for the duration of 2013.\n\nHaving impressed with the colourful [Departure](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/20094-new-kodak-to-graph-departure/) in February, and the vibrant [Able](https://soundcloud.com/kodaktograph/able) in March, he’s offered up _Aurescent_ as April’s track. A swirling, multi-layered number, working with complex percussion patterns, it’s by far the most atmospheric track in his series so far. What’s more, his ability to intertwine vocals appears to improve with each and every track, cementing his position as one of the finest young producers around at this moment in time.",
