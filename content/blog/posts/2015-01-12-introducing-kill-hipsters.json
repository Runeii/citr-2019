  "body": "Pretty slow on the uptake with Buenos Aires four piece **Kill All Hipsters**, but I’m mightily glad that I eventually stumbled across them.\n\nRaucous, brash yet delightfully melodic, their debut six track EP comes across as somewhere between current hype band Hinds (FKA Deers) and XL signed Savages, with a bit of Sleater-Kinney thrown in for good measure. Switching between English and Spanish, their lyrics range from painstakingly honest (“Somehow I feel scared to death with you”) to devilishly suggestive – “I can’t help myself / fingers down my sex”. Check out a couple of EP highlights below and grab the full release from their [Bandcamp](http://killallhipsters.bandcamp.com/). (PS. would kill to hear a studio take on their version of Gorillaz’ [Kids With Guns](https://soundcloud.com/killallhipsters/kids-with-guns).)\n\n<a href=\"http://killallhipsters.bandcamp.com/album/-\">乾杯 by Kill All Hipsters</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://killallhipsters.bandcamp.com/album/-\">乾杯 by Kill All Hipsters</a>",
