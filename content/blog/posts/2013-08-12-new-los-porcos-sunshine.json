  "body": "Photo: Cécilia Montesinos\n\nYacht rock partiers **Los Porcos** are rapidly converting everyone to their unique brand of happy go lucky surf pop.\n\nWith a live show that appears as unrehearsed as it is mind-blowingly brilliant, their new track Sunshine is a real 80’s throwback, and about as far from the call-to-arms rigidity of **WU LYF** as one could possibly imagine. Released 15 September on [Caledonia Reco](http://www.caledoniarecords.bigcartel.com/)rds, it’s safe to say that the pigs are here to stay. Check out Sunshine below, and a live video taken at MIDI Festival.",
