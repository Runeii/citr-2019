  "body": "Brisbane duo **Autumn** showed early promise on their two debut offerings, Breathe Out and Ghost, and are now prepping the release of their debut album, _Shivers_.\n\nThe title track shows them taking a darker turn, more sinister and foreboding than perhaps expected, it’s elegant and minimal, with some of the slower moments on Lorde’s LP being the closest comparison, whilst the beat feels more Purity Ring inspired. Check it out below.",
