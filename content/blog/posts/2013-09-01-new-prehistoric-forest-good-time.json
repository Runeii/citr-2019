  "body": "Having taken their demo EP down from their Bandcamp page (although it’s still available on their [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/prehistoric-forest)), New Jersey’s **Prehistoric Forest** are truly in ‘album prepping mode’. Exploding onto these pages with their fantastic [debut single](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/19782-new-prehistoric-forest-the-dark-ages/) back in February, the quintet returned with the slower paced _Your Move_ midway through June, and have now followed that up with the absolutely brilliant _Good Time_. As with _The Dark Ages_, it’s another slice of early **Strokes** inspired rock and roll. Check out both _Good Time_ and _Your Move_ below.",
