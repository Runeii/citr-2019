They were stripped down, had the balls of a bull and still managed to tell stories, more importantly they managed to tell believable ones. It seems **Natural Child** have entered the scene with their self-titled EP at the perfect point then. Totaling at around 9 minutes if you blink, shut your ears or perhaps even think about something else for more than a moment it’s likely you’ll miss something. This is by no means a criticism, packed into this riff heavy, ballsy slice of rock n’ roll is a world that **Natural Child** desperately tries to explain to us. Stories of wild parties, screwing girls you don’t particularly want to and smoking crack with friends become normality. They drag you kicking and screaming into their self assured, angst ridden world leaving you with a bucket load of fascination whether you like it or not. Download the EP below.  \n[](http://www.mediafire.com/?53yzzmvmhhn)\n\n[Click here to download](http://www.mediafire.com/?53yzzmvmhhn)",
