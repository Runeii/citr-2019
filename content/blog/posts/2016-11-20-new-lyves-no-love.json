  "body": "It’s been the best part of eight months since we last heard from London’s **Lyves**, and in that time she’s been working on a new EP, entitled Like Water, out at the start of next year.\n\n_Two Years_, the first track lifted from the release, is a substantial development of her sound – taking the smooth, R&B infused vibe that dominated her earlier tracks in a more confident and pop ready direction. Whilst the sense of longing and lust hangs heavy, there’s courage and determination to the songwriting that clings to every note. Check out No Love below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
