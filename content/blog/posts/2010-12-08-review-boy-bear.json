  "body": "Walking into Manchester’s fantastic **Night & Day Cafe**, I was met with a packed out room that was bustling with excitement and anticipation.\n\nThe Australian folk outfit **Boy & Bear** appear to have massed quite a large and enthused following since they were first seen supporting **Laura Marling** several months back. A bottle of finest Newcastle Brown in hand, and my colleague for the night **Jonny Hudspith** perched up to the bar with me, **Andrew Davie** took to the stage.\n\n**Andrew Davie:**\n\nThe ex-lead man from **Cherbourg**, **Andrew Davie** certainly fitted the folky theme of tonight’s proceedings, but perhaps his solo nature would be lost amongst the swathes of **Boy & Bear** fans? Answer: absolutely not. Quiet yet powerful, **Andrew Davie** produced a set that grabbed the attention of many in the audience. His tracks are very personal, regularly referencing himself and other figures or characters, providing a window of intimacy that instantly absorbs your attention. It is **Davie**‘s lyrics that separate him from the countless others who consider themselves ‘singer/songwriters’, as within his tracks the lyrics portray a sense of painful questioning that is soothed by an endearing resilience while remaining personal enough to become accessible for an audience to appreciate. However credit must also be attributed to **Davie**‘s vocals, which have tinges of **Conor Oberst** and **Bon Iver** in them, as while much of his tracks’ content express pain and hurt, **Davie**‘s vocals portray a feeling of innocent naivety that softens yet empowers each track. Particular highlights in his set were ‘**Elysium**‘ and ‘**Dangerous Thoughts**‘, and while **Davie** is yet to officially release any of his solo material, I recommend you check out this fantastic artist post haste.\n\n8/10\n\n**Lupen Crook:**\n\nMoving away from the quiet atmosphere of **Andrew Davie**, **Lupen Crook** & co took to the stage with a clear exuberance. Reported by many as producing a ‘twisted take on folk music’, **Lupen Crook** produced a set that was lively and entertaining. **Lupen**‘s vocals are not too dissimilar to a slightly calmer **Frank Turner**, however they contain the same spirit and energy that **Turner** manages to encapsulate in his tracks. This mixed with erratic clangs of percussion and jangly guitars, **Lupen Crook** certainly provided the audience with a sharp contrast to the music that was to act as the night’s finale. However **Lupen** only received a mild reception from an audience that appeared to initially be interested and excited about his twisted folk, but then quite readily descended back into their own batches of small talk. A good performance that sadly still leaves the question unanswered as to why **Lupen Crook** hasn’t made more of a name for himself.\n\n7/10\n\n**Boy & Bear:**\n\nWith an immediate charisma and charm, **Boy & Bear** produced a flawless and engaging set that left no fan wanting. Sparked by their earlier appearance  supporting **Laura Marling**, people quite oddly compared the band to **Mumford & Sons**. Now while the band do play folk inspired music, and are known to wear their fair share of tweed, it is here that the comparison to **Mumford** & co should end. While the band do centre around a central figure of **Dave Hosking**, I would be more tempted to compare the band’s sound to that of **Local Natives**. The music is of course far more acoustic than that of **Local Natives**, **Boy & Bear** include that same dreamy yet empowered sound that floods the music of **Local Natives**. Choral vocals layered throughout music which is buoyed by reverb-y guitars and centralised percussion is a common feature between the two bands and, as a result, gives **Boy & Bear** the charm of a folk band whilst creating the musical integrity of further reaching genres. However regardless of the debate of musical comparisons, **Boy & Bear** have managed to create a refreshing sound that is catchy enough to dance to and interesting enough to hold your attention. The band have recently released their EP ‘**With Emperor Antarctica**‘, which I highly recommend you purchase as soon as you can, with ‘**Rabbit Song**‘ and ‘**Mexican Mavis**‘ being particular highlights.\n\n9/10\n\n[Boy & Bear Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/boyandbearmusic)\n\n[Andrew Davie Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/andrewdavie)\n\n[Lupen Crook Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/lupencrook)",
