Making their only Scottish festival appearanceof the year the show marks not only their first ever headlining gig but also their first major show since the departure of ex Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr.\n\nFor most bands the departure of a legendary guitar hero from the group would be a devastating blow but for The Cribs the return to the visceral, thrilling and chaotic 3 piece line up that made their name seems to have re-invigorated the band, the back to basics approach suiting their straight ahead hook filled anthemic guitar rock. Arriving in Scotland with the promise of playing some new songs from their forthcoming fifth album the brothers Jarman promise to be one of Rockness’ must see attractions. Be sure to catch the start of the next phase in the career of one of the UK’s most exciting live acts.",
