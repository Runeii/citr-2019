  "body": "Elle Olsun’s latest single _Crying Over You_ is a smooth, futuristic take on a style most will be well acquainted with.\n\nCrossing elements of soul and funk with spacey vocals and instrumentals Elle has crafted a subtly unique sound for herself. Crying over you feels like almost jazzy with it’s more regimented stiff drums and bass letting the more playful wind instruments, synths and backing vocals gently prance around the track. The songs chorus feels like the perfectly constructed platform for Elle to work; her vocal rides the spaceyness of the synths elegantly and gives Crying Over You a really sweet soul. Check out the track below.",
