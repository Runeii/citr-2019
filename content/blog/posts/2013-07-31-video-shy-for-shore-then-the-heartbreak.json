  "body": "London / Amsterdam based duo **Shy For Shore** have one of the most intoxicating sounds of the year.\n\nOn their stunning debut EP, **_Sometimes It’s A Heartbreak Not To Introduce Yourself_**, they fuse a mirage of modern influences (Purity Ring, Beach House etc., with touches of classic 90’s pop, to miraculous effect. Their debut music video, for lead single _Then The Heartbreak_ is a beautifully twee affair, featuring professional dancer Moreno Perna, hauntingly in-keeping with the majestic nature of the track. Check out the video below, and pick up the EP from Bandcamp on a [name-your-price](http://shyforshore.bandcamp.com/album/sometimes-its-a-heartbreak-not-to-introduce-yourself) basis.",
