  "body": "I’ve spent a decent part of this evening trying to get my head around **Cristin Young**.\n\nHailing from China, her [instagram](http://instagram.com/cristin_young) paints the picture of someone who spends a great deal of time travelling, rarely settling in one place, and her only other social media (aside from the below Bandcamp page) is a VK page (understandable given her whereabouts) and a [Tumblr](http://cristin-young.tumblr.com/). Her music is quite distant, otherworldly in parts, yet startlingly beautiful. Take the transcendent _We Are Birds_, or the more upbeat, EP opener _Asia_, there’s a colossal variety in her sound, and one that’s purposefully hard to pin down. For now, Cristin Young appears as somewhat of an enigma, a majestic one at that. Stream _We Are Birds_ below, and the EP in full underneath that.",
