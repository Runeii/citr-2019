  "body": "Ten years from now, media theorists will study **Kitty Pryde** and the affect that her rapping had on the music industry and the cultural sphere as a whole.\n\nFrom describing her as ‘going viral’ to ‘an outcast white girl’, what all their years of work and attempts to categorise the pint-sized rapper will ultimately boil down to, is that she’s REALLY good. Her newest teaser track _☠DEAD❤ISLAND☠_ (emoticons intentional) is only going to serve to build hype around the nineteen year old, and her upcoming EP _**D.A.I.S.Y. Rage**_. Check out the clip below, described by Kitty herself as ‘the sparkliest video of all time’.",
