  "body": "Having appeared briefly last year with their debut track **A Long Walk Home for Parted Lovers, **a song that disappeared within hours of materialising online, New Zealand group Yumi Zouma have returned, announcing a release through Cascine.\n\nTheir self-titled EP will drop 11 Feb, and lead single _The Brae_ lifted from the EP is swoon worthy dream pop personified. With a riff that would have Teenage Fanclub turning green, it’s a fantastic way to re-announce their arrival. Stream it below, and grab the EP from [Cascine](http://shop.cascine.us/product/yumi-zouma-ep). ([Premiered on GvB](http://www.gorillavsbear.net/2014/01/13/premiere-yumi-zouma-the-brae/))",
