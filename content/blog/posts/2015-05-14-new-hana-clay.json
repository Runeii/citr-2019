  "body": "With Grimes, Lorde and Lana Del Rey already declaring themselves fans,  it’s clear that **HANA** (Hana Pestle) may well be onto something rather special.\n\nSubtle and beautifully composed, her debut track, _Clay_, hints at chart aimed pop hooks, yet the cutting sadness to her lyrics helps keep it grounded, refusing to drift into the realms of feeling contrived or forced.
