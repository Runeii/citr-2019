  "body": "**The winner of the BBC sound of 2012 poll of music critics, broadcasters & bloggers has been announced as British soul musician Michael Kiwanuka.**\n\nCompared to Bill Withers, Van Morrison and the Temptations, Kiwanuka’s brand of retro soul, RnB & folk was inspired from a most unlikely discovery. A rare recording of Otis Redding’s [Sitting On The Dock of the Bay](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCmUhYSr-e4 \"Otis Redding - Sitting On The Dock of the Bay [YOUTUBE]\") stuck to the front of a magazine tribute to Bob Dylan.\n\n“I love that sound,” Kiwanuka told the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16266507 \"Michael Kiwanuka BBC Interview - 6th Jan\") earlier today “The singers I listen to are quite old-school and I think that era is really cool. The way the chords sounded, and the feeling of the playing is very loose. There’s a jazz feel compared to a lot of modern music, which is very straight.”\n\nThe 24 year old North Londoner came out tops in the [BBC Sound of 2012](http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/soundof/2012/ \"BBC Sound of 2012 award\") poll ahead of Singer-songwriter Frank Ocean, Rapper Azealia Banks, producer DJ Skrillex and Swedish electro-duo Niki and The Dove.\n\nMichael Kiwanuka will be playing a number of intimate gigs across the UK & Ireland over the next few months.His new EP ‘Home Again’ is officially released on [Polydor Records](http://www.polydor.co.uk/ \"Polydor Records\") on the 26th March 2012 following his debut ‘I’m Getting Ready’ released last year on [Interscope](http://www.interscope.com/ \"I'm Getting Ready Michael Kiwanuka\").
