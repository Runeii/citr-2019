  "body": "Actually found out about Chicago’s **Jude Shuma** through band of the moment, [Bully](http://admin.</p><p>crackintheroad.com/music/31103-new-bully-i-remember); whilst playing some tracks on their Soundcloud, I noticed a single ‘like’ from their profile, on a track by **Shuma**. (Hey, it might have come from management/label etc. but that’s besides the point) Sporting some psychedelic, Tame Impala vibes, his two tracks to date, _Subterranean Feelings_ and _Wandering_ are engrossing and captivating compositions; definitely one to watch out for.\n\nFollow our [Spotify On Repeat playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a hand-picked selection of the current hottest tracks.",
