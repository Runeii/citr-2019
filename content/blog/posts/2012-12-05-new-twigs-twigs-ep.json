  "body": "I’ve spent most of this afternoon/evening lugging industrial lights across London, so it was with both joy and relief that I found this long awaited delight in my inbox.\n\n**[Twigs](http://twigstwigs.bandcamp.com/)** has been compelling anyone who happens to be a fan of music for a little while now. Her first two tracks, _Ache_ and _Hide_ had something of **[Lykke Li](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/7150-video-lykke-li-sadness-is-a-blessing/ \"Video: Lykke Li – Sadness Is a Blessing\")** about them, loosely, but enough to claim the attention of the masses. Perhaps now the comparison is unfair, as a full body of work the _Twigs EP_ has more in common with **Actress** or **Lukid** than it does **Li**. The exterior is at times vulnerable, but at her core, **Twigs** is housing a while load of darkness.\n\nStream the EP below and after check out the video for each track.",
