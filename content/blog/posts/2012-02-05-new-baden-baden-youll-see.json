  "date": "2012-02-05T21:49:14",
  "body": "This new track from Paris’s **Baden Baden** embodies a youthful energy that is nigh on impossible to put into words.\n\nWonderfully upbeat in a way that only European pop bands appear able to muster, with the lyrics half sung, half spoken. Whilst it’s still several months till we’re graced with the presence of summer, it seems like nobody has informed **Baden Baden**, and I hope nobody does. Stream _You’ll See_ below, and grab a free download while you can.\n\n<a href=\"http://badenbadenmusic.bandcamp.com/track/youll-see\">YOU&#8217;LL SEE by BADEN BADEN</a>",
