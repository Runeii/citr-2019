With the deep, rolling synth sections, and sampled vocals that dominate much of **SOHN’s** own work, it’s far and away her finest track to date. It’s bold, delicately poignant, and effortlessly slick. A host of tour dates coming up with The Weeknd, and rumours of numerous other collaborations in the works, _Waiting Game_ is just the start of a very exciting few months for **BANKS**.",
