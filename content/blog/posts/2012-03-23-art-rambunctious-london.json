A great source of pride for the British nation and a major pain in the arse for those of us who live in the capital, there are at least a few cultural and artistic distractions to keep our minds off the fact that we Londoners are going to be spending a few months in what essentially amounts to a military base filled with tourists.\n\nCue _Rambunctious London_. A collection of artwork by “creator, inventor, philanthropist, explorer, scientist, artist and gentleman” **Joseph Alberstein Goode** (who has previously designed for High Voltage, Wilderness Festival and the Secret Garden Party, this tongue-in-cheek antidote to the city’s ever-worsening chaos provides a comical insight into the city of London through an array of drawings from witty portraits of city stereotypes to a fascinating alternative map of the London Underground.\n\nAt the centre of the collection lies _London 2012_, a beautifully detailed large-scale art print that brilliantly showcases the eccentricities of **Goode**‘s mind, and contains countless references to various aspects of city life. Elsewhere, one can find _Shoreditch Dandy_ (a caricature of that not-really-loveable Shoreditch hipster that we’ve all met at one point in our lives), _London Underground (_the aforementioned tube map drawn in **Goode**‘s unique style) and _London_ (another giant print that packs in the most recognisable aspects of the city’s culture) and many more.\n\nThe works (and others) are available online and at certain retail outlets across the city, and are definitely worth a look at least. The collection really, genuinely does capture the city and its quirks beautifully, and at a time when the eyes of the world are on the city, what could be better?\n\nFor more information (and a preview of some of the other works), see [http://www.londoncartoons.co.uk/](http://www.londoncartoons.co.uk/#), or have a look below at our preview of _London 2012_.\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/attachment-260x618.jpg \"attachment\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/15788-art-rambunctious-london/attachment/attachment/)",
