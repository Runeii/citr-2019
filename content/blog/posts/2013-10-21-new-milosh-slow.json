  "body": "Mike Milosh is back making music under his solo-act moniker, Milosh.\n\nIf his name isn’t ringing any bells perhaps it’s worth pointing out that he is one half of the sultry-electro duo Rhye?\n\nYeahhhh.\n\n“Slow Down” is a gorgeous track that unfolds almost as slowly as it begs “Can we all just slow down?”. Here Milosh lets his increasingly famous vocals stand almost entirely on their own, with just the faintest hint of piano to carry things along.\n\nIt’s a sobering track and fans of Rhye will find it easy to slip in to Milosh’s sound, coming on almost like the cuddle that follows the passionate throes of Rhye.\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/114924669″ width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]",
