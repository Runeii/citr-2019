  "body": "**Slugabed** is one of those loud, erratic producers who you could imagine never blinking and just living off ear-piercing noises (ironic considering his sloth-like moniker), so I was surprised when he released a couple of surprisingly tame EP’s on **Ninja Tune** recently.\n\nWhat I remember of him is intense, head-crushing 8-bit noises – the kinda stuff that’d drive your parents Jack Torrance-insane. Luckily, according to a recent announcement, **Slugabed**‘s gonna give us all a weekly advent calendar treat of an old unreleased track of his. And this is the first – another track about kittens by another hip-hop-head. Suck this, keyboard cat.\n\n_Stream and download Kittens below. Moonbeam Rider EP and Sun Too Bright Turn It Off EP are available on 12″ and download now via Ninja Tune._",
