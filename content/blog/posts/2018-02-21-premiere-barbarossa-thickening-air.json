  "body": "The second single from his highly anticipated forthcoming album, Lier, this latest track from Margate based James Mathé aka **Barbarossa** is a slick, soulful affair.\n\nHaving moved from his birthplace of London, and become a father since the release of his 2015 album, Imager, there’s no doubt plenty of stories to be told on Lier.\n\n_Thickening Air_ feels like a homage to truly classic songwriters, with its vibrant melodies and focus on the uplifting chorus. It’s songwriting at its most bewitching and downright addictive, and one of this years finest singles thus far.\n\n_Lier_ is released 30 March via Memphis Industries.
