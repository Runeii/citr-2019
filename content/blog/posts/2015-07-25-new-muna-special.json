  "date": "2015-07-25T13:28:21",
  "body": "LA’s **MUNA** have whipped up a bit of a storm recently with their new track _So Special_, a song that is fully deserving of this flurry of excitement.\n\nBuilding upon their self-professed ‘dark pop’, **MUNA** have created a sound more fully formed than their previous efforts, but sacrifice none of the raw and beautiful emotion that the trio so expertly convey. Obvious comparisons to fellow ‘Los Angelians’ HAIM are inevitable, but they have crafted out a sound that is entirely their own, with the jumping bass line and compressed production elevating the vocals to spectacularly ethereal and raw heights.\n\nCatch them at LA’s Silverlake Lounge on July 7th and stream _So Special_ below.\n\nFollow our [Spotify On Repeat playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a hand-picked selection of the current hottest tracks.",
