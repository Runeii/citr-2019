  "date": "2011-09-27T00:56:06",
  "body": "**Stray Kites** are hands down the cutest duo in music.\n\nWhilst on first listen their lo-fi acoustic-driven tracks can appear harsh and slightly grating; with further listens the lyrics begin to speak for themselves and the bond between **Junior Roseboro** and **Max Detrich** becomes ever prominent. With this, their first official music video, for _Talking Plaster Walls pt.3_ taken from sophomore album _**Mieux**_, they show just how far they’ve come in the short time they’ve been around. Echoing the youthful spirit and sultry yet optimistic feeling of the track, the video is comprised of numerous clips of distorted iconic moments; be it a young child on a swing or a teenager skimming stones, you get the impression that _Talking Plaster Walls pt.3_ mirrors the invaluable friendship between **Roseboro** and **Detrich**. Check out the video below and head over to the **Stray Kites** [bandcamp](http://straykites.bandcamp.com/) to get their newest album _**Mieux**_ on a pay-what-you-like basis.",
