  "body": "Opening with a gorgeously washed out synth, _Strange Enough_, the latest track from NYC’s **VÉRITÉ** falls away into into a prelude of the massive chorus that lies ahead.\n\nA subdued verse draws you in, her contemplative vocals soft and brooding and act as the centrepiece of it all. When the chorus hits, it really hits, exploding with a crushing snare as the production is amped up and everything really starts to get going. At just over 10,000 listens and the Hype Machine charts screaming her name, **VÉRITÉ** is certainly one to watch in the closing months of 2014.",
