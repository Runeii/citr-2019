  "title": "New: Ryan Hemsworth – Perfectly",
  "date": "2013-05-16T20:30:19",
  "body": "**Ryan Hemsworth**, without running it by anyone worthy of making such a large decision, has decided to become one of the most sought after producers in hip-hop.\n\nMeanwhile he’s still belting out funasfuck instrumentals, that according to the man himself will be slight in comparison to the featuring tracks that make up his debut LP. I’ll be interested to see what the split is.\n\n_Perfectly_, taken from his EP _Still Awake_, is due to drop next week and gives us an idea of what the collection of tunes may sound like. This is fun as hell beat music, but as with all of **Hemsworth**’s work he cleverly undercuts the experience with decisions that shifts the piece into an area of sorrow and contemplativeness.",
