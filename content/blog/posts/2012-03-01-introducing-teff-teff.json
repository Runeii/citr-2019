  "body": "Duo’s appear to be 2012’s buzz word; **Keep Shelly In Athens**, **Stay +**, **Lockets**, hell almost everyone deemed worthy of hype seems to be part of two piece.\n\nLA’s **Teff-Teff**, translated in old Japanese as ‘butterfly’, may well be the next name to add to that ever growing list. Composed of singer **Aoife O’Leary** and **Ryuji Morita**, their three debut demo tracks are wonderfully languid home-produced dreampop inspired affairs, with nostalgic synths and steady percussion sections all rounded off by **O’Leary’s** sumptuously dreamy vocals.\n\nAt times there’s a warming realism to their music, as the instrumental and vocal parts seem to diverge, before joining up again further along their course. Comparisons could easily be drawn to the aforementioned **Keep Shelly In Athens**, however there’s a more 90’s, **Cocteau Twins** atmospheric undertow to **Teff-Teff’s** music. Check out _New Born_ below, and keep up to date with the duo via their [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Teff-Teff/353139808039939?sk=info) or [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/teff-teff).",
