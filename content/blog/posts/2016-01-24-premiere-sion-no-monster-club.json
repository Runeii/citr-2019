Bobby draws influence from across the indie rock landscape and bundles it all together in his unique lo-fi style.\n\n“I came up with all of the composite parts during the Carnaval parade in Sion, Switzerland last Valentine’s Day.” Bobby told us “The next day, I stitched them all together into a rough, drunken Jack Torrance demo in the ancient and creepy Hotel Europa (where Verdi used to live and Napoleon once stayed) in Ferrara, Italy. The lyrics came later.”\n\n—-\n\n_Next week we’re [throwing a party](https://www.facebook.com/events/1521993634764615/) for all of the readers, writers, musicians and artists that have made Crack In The Road what it is today. We’re flying No Monster Club into the capital for the occasion and it’s your chance grab a copy of their new record ‘I Feel Magic’, ahead of its release on February 19th 2016. digital edition/CD available from Popical Island (Europe) and cassette tape available from Already Dead Tapes & Records (USA)._\n\n_Check out the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1521993634764615/) for more. _",
