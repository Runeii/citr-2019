With the likes of Foals already established, and bands such as Alphabet Backwards, Spring Offensive and Trophy Wife hoping to stir up the mainstream, there’s quite rightly an enthusiastic vibe around the city’s music scene. Having signed to Moshi Moshi Records toward the latter end of 2010, Trophy Wife are beginning to make a name for themselves with their melodic, lush sound. Numerous comparisons have been made to math-rock outfit Foals, so it’s no surprise to learn they are tour mates of the Oxford band.\n\nLast year’s single Microlite could easily have been mistaken for a bonus track from Antidotes, not necessarily a negative aspect of the track. New song The Quiet Earth is as much Toro y Moi as is it Foals, brooding guitars combine elegantly with shimmering vocals, allowing for a picturesque, organic track. Well worth a listen.\n\n [Trophy Wife – The Quiet Earth](http://soundcloud.com/anoraklondon/trophy-wife-the-quiet-earth-1) by [Anorak London](http://soundcloud.com/anoraklondon)",
