Yep, you guessed it, Australia.\n\nThis trio of perfect pop princesses (Aimee Cavanagh, Genevieve Bufalino and Irena Lysiuk) are set to take blogs by storm with their recent single _Running Out_. So it’s definitely right in line with the current ‘in’ sound; slightly delirious, sugary synth pop, but don’t let that distract you from what is a fantastically crafted pop song. Listen to _Running Out_ below.",
