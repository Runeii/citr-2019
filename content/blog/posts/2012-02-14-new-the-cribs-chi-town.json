  "body": "With their first new material since 2009’s Ignore The Ignorant, The Cribs had their new single Chi-Town premiered on Zane Lowe’s BBC earlier this evening.\n\nAs to be expected, it’s a raucous slice of indie-rock, all centered around a killer chorus and Ryan Jarman’s unique vocals. The Cribs fifth studio album _In The Belly Of The Brazen Bull_ will be released on 7 May, with David Fridman and Steve Albini on production duties. Check out Chi-Town below, and the tracklisting below that.\n\n_Glitters Like Gold_  \n_Come On Be A No-One_  \n_Jaded Youth_  \n_Anna_  \n_Confident Men_  \n_Uptight_  \n_Chi-Town_  \n_Pure O_  \n_Back To The Bolthole_  \n_I Should Have Helped_  \n_Stalagmites_  \n_Like A Gift Giver_  \n_Butterflies_  \n_Arena Rock Encore With Full Cast_",
