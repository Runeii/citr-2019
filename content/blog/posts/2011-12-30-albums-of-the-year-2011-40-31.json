Enjoy.\n\n#40 **Elite Gymnastics** – _**RUIN**_\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/elite-gymnastics-ruin.jpg \"Elite Gymnastics - Ruin\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/editorials/13373-albums-of-the-year-2011-40-31/attachment/elite-gymnastics-ruin/)\n\nAs well as providing several of the best remixes of the year, Minneapolis duo **Elite Gymnastics** wowed everyone with their debut LP entitled **_RUIN_**. Combining a stellar knowledge of dance music, with lo-fi, haunting undertones, the release has quite rightly found it’s way into several end of year lists. JD.\n\n#39 **Grouper** – _**A I A**_\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/GROUPER.jpg \"Grouper - A I A\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/editorials/13373-albums-of-the-year-2011-40-31/attachment/grouper/)\n\nMade up of two parts; _**Alien Observer**_ and _**Dream Loss**_, **Liz Harris** and her solo outfit **Grouper** stepped out from the shadows somewhat in 2011. With it’s minimal feel and ethereal atmosphere, _**A I A**_ is **Grouper’s** most complete release to date. JD.\n\n#38 **Pure X** – **_Ecstasy_**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Pure-X-Pleasure.jpg \"Pure X - Pleasure\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/editorials/13373-albums-of-the-year-2011-40-31/attachment/pure-x-pleasure/)\n\nTexas trio **Pure X** (formerly **Pure Ecstasy**) created quite a stir with their emotionally fraught and appealingly gritty debut LP. Another record built upon lo-fi production methods and stunning vocal sections that has made an impact in numerous end of year lists. JD.\n\n#37 _**White Denim**_ – **_D_**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/WHITE-DENIM-D-575x575.jpg \"White Denim - D\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/editorials/13373-albums-of-the-year-2011-40-31/attachment/white-denim-d-575x575/)\n\nOriginally released digitally as a collection of B-sides and unreleased tracks, **White Denim** gave _**D**_ the full LP release that it’s quality deserves. JD.\n\n#36  **Kurt Vile** – _**Smoke Ring For My Halo**_\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Akurt_art_ada.jpg \"Kurt Vile - Smoke Ring For My Halo\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/editorials/13373-albums-of-the-year-2011-40-31/attachment/akurt_art_ada/)\n\nA brilliant album, building on the potential of **Kurt Vile’s** earlier records to fund a lush, melancholic journey through underground Americana. Still sounding fresh nine months after it’s original release, the pressure is well and truly on to follow up from the critical acclaim of the record. WT\n\n#35 **Gang Gang Dance** – **_Eye Contact_**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/eyecontact.jpg \"Gang Gang Dance - Eye Contact\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/editorials/13373-albums-of-the-year-2011-40-31/attachment/eyecontact/)\n\nThree years in the making, **Gang Gang Dance** unveiled **_Eye Contact_** by playing several shows at Animal Collective’s ATP in May. Featuring **Alexis Taylor** (of Hot Chip), the record saw the group adopting a more dance orientated approach, blending it with their experimental influences.\n\n#34 **Toro y Moi** – _**Underneath The Pine**_\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/618LLYN7ELL._SS500_.jpg \"Toro y Moi - Underneath The Pine\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/editorials/13373-albums-of-the-year-2011-40-31/attachment/618llyn7ell-_ss500_/)\n\nReleased all the way back in February, _**Underneath the Pine**_ represented a refusal to be held by genre and comfortably leads the way in ignoring every tired term used to describe **Toro Y Moi**. A wonderful second record, with the legs on it to be appreciated over and over and over. WT.\n\n#33 **James Blake** – _**James Blake**_\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/JAMES-BLAKE-LP.jpg \"James Blake - James Blake\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/editorials/13373-albums-of-the-year-2011-40-31/attachment/james-blake-lp/)\n\nAfter the phenomenal success of his initial EP’s, **Blake** provided an album of entirely new material, and focusing more on his songwriting ability rather than his unique production values. Released way back in January, it’s seemingly slipped down the pecking order in many end of year lists. JD.\n\n#32 **Atlas Sound** – _**Parallax**_\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Atlas-Sound-608x6081.jpg \"Atlas Sound - Parallax\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/editorials/13373-albums-of-the-year-2011-40-31/attachment/atlas-sound-608x6081/)\n\nWith his third record under the **Atlas Sound** moniker, **Bradford Cox** cemented his position as one of the most talented, innovative songwriters of our generation. Relying upon his own self-perceived failings and personal frailties, **_Parallax_** is a more refined listen, yet falls slightly short of the phenomenal high standard set by previous efforts. JD.\n\n#31 **Bon Iver** – _**Bon Iver**_\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Bon-Iver-Album-Cover3.jpg \"Bon Iver - Bon Iver\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/editorials/13373-albums-of-the-year-2011-40-31/attachment/bon-iver-album-cover3/)\n\nSplitting opinion more than Lana Del Rey, **Bon Iver’s** follow up to 2007’s critically acclaimed **_For Emma, Forever Go_**, saw the trio adopting a more expansive sound. A collection of folk-pop tracks, culminating in the Phil Collins-esque album closer _Beth / Rest_, the self-titled record’s success has been recognized with a Grammy nomination. JD.",
