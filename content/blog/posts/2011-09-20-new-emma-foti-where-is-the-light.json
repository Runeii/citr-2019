  "date": "2011-09-20T15:00:59",
  "body": "This gorgeous acoustic number comes courtesy of New York songstress **Emma Foti**.\n\nEntirely acoustic tracks can be defiantly difficult to write and often accused of lacking soul however **Emma’s** enchanting voice ensures _Where Is The Light_ develops a real personality of it’s own. The **Laura Marling** and **Feist** influences are resounding but not all consuming, whilst the lyrics are vulnerably honest; _‘my past is hollow my virtue is gone, pride in the things that I am not, flowers bloom but my feet are cold, you make it look easy and i grow old’_. Stream or download it for free below.\n\n<a href=\"http://emma2.bandcamp.com/track/where-is-the-light\">Where is the Light by Emma Foti</a>",
