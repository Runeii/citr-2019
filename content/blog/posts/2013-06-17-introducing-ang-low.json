  "body": "Fresh out the blocks, Brooklyn’s **Ang Low** (Angelo Whitehead)backed by production duo Dan Drohan and Jeff Fettig, has just dropped his debut track, the stunning Life Goes Down.\n\nSo it fits rather snuggly into the R&B / indie crossover, alongside the likes of Bipolar Sunshine and The Neighbourhood, with it’s clean, precise production and slick vocal sectionsfa, but that’s by no means a fault. With this, **Ang Low’s** first release, it’s ambitious and certainly crying out with commercial intentions, whilst remaining a touching love song at its silky core.
