  "date": "2014-08-10T17:37:37",
  "body": "It’s been a while since we’ve heard anything from Irish wunder-kid **MMOTHS**, but he has returned in his ever spectacular fashion with the ethereal and hauntingly beautiful _Santo_.\n\nIt twists and turns in synthetic glory and builds into and explosive and spine tingling outro, drenched in a hot flux of burning electronics and vocals awash with reverb. An album is expected early next year and judging by this track, it’s going to worth the wait.",
