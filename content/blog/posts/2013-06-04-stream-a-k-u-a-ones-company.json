  "body": "My love for Canadian future-pop star **A K U A** grows by the day, and with the release of her fantastic debut EP, _**One’s Company**_, it’s likely that she’s not going to remain a secret for much longer.\n\nFeaturing the previously heard _Gravity_, _Push_ and _Told You So_, alongside new cuts _Monster_ and _One’s Company_, it’s an intoxicating listen, fusing choppy beats with her utterly unique vocals. What’s most impressive about **A K U A** above all, is just how fresh she sounds, whilst drawing from early 00’s pop inspirations, and mid 80’s R&B, it remains a distinctive and modern approach. Check out the EP in full below.",
