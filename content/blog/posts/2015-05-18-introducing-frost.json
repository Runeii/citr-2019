  "body": "Prior to releasing his debut track today, all we had from Australian singer/producer **FROST** was a remix of _that _Hozier song.\n\nHis debut outing, _Dreaming_, is glorious, in managing to sound deeply intimate yet spacious, merging beats that the likes of Jon Hopkins and Jamie XX thrive on, with a Chet Faker-esque soulful vocal. Check it out below, alongside his Take Me To Church remix.\n\nFollow our [Spotify On Repeat playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a hand-picked selection of the current hottest tracks.",
