  "body": "This debut track from Minneapolis’s [**Sombear**](http://www.facebook.com/Sombear?sk=info) is pretty special. The side-project of **Bradley Hale** of **Now, Now**, **Sombear** finds him exploring his electronic and pop influences, and breathing a more expansive atmosphere into first track _Easy Thief_.
