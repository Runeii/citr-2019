  "body": "Who’d ever thought sexy ladies in their undies could belong on your bedroom shelf? Unless you’ve buffed up Barbie, or dig the Bratz (Slutz), then all your dreams have come true.\n\nAll hail **Lucy Kirk** for creating her new series: **Showgirls**.  You can take your pick from Poppy, Jess, Tegan or even Meg, who looks especially naughty. For your viewing pleasure, please click [**HERE**](http://www.lucy-kirk.co.uk/index.php?/showgirls/ceramics-/).\n\nAll joking aside, I can’t see anyone not having a giggle to Lucys work, and this is what I love about it. I can imagine trying to mould provocative poses on a small scale quite a tricky job, but it’s the bumpy and slightly swished limbs that make them so endearing and entertaining. Not to mention the accompaniment of bored expressions.\n\nShe has also teamed up with fellow Brighton graduate, **Millie Popovic**, to create **Pen on Paper (POP),** a partnership established ‘_because of our mutual love of lidos, partially dressed swimmers and hay barns’,_ evident in their Swimmer Notebooks and Tanning T-shirts.\n\nShowgirls, swimmers, garters, haybails…it think I need to fetch a hot flannel! What I sense is a playfulness at the people who are seemingly ‘on stage’; the places where people are seen in their fleshy egos. It must be a lot of fun putting these characters into everyday contexts, and this might just be what fuels the fire (literally, she’s probably got a kiln) in the world of Lucy Kirk.\n\n#gallery-1 { margin: auto; } #gallery-1 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } #gallery-1 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-1 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } /\\* see gallery\\_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php \\*/\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-shot-2013-04-02-at-23.27.49-150x150.png)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/20749-artist-profile-lucy-kirk/attachment/screen-shot-2013-04-02-at-23-27-49)\n\nJess\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-shot-2013-04-03-at-21.04.32-150x150.png)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/20749-artist-profile-lucy-kirk/attachment/screen-shot-2013-04-03-at-21-04-32)\n\nMeg\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-shot-2013-04-03-at-21.04.51-150x150.png)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/20749-artist-profile-lucy-kirk/attachment/screen-shot-2013-04-03-at-21-04-51)\n\nPoppy\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-shot-2013-04-03-at-21.17.37-150x150.png)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/20749-artist-profile-lucy-kirk/attachment/screen-shot-2013-04-03-at-21-17-37)\n\nScarlett",
