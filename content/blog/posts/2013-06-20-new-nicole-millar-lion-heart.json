  "date": "2013-06-20T23:43:39",
  "body": "Not quite as ‘chillwave’ as the continued use of the word on her social media would have you believe, Sydney’s **Nicole Millar** is so much more than a mere tag dreamt up by Hipster Runoff to infuriate music bloggers.\n\nHaving collaborated with the likes of PhaseOne and Cosmo’s Midnight, her recent release, _Lion Heart_, sees her taking centre stage. As we’ve come to expect from electronic Australian music, the production is spotlessly sleek, and glistening with Millar’s silky smooth vocals. Not to discredit her previous work, but with more tracks of similar quality to Lion Heart, there’s no reason why **Nicole Millar** can’t be a pop-star in her own right.",
