  "body": "There’s quite a cool self-described ‘future-pop’ scene coming out of Florida right now, with **Chandler Strang** also of Saskatchewan, X Priest X and Case Work very much at the centre of it all.\n\n**Dromes**, his solo project, comes across as slightly understated, yet no less impressive, with a host of unofficial remixes (Timberlake & Rihanna included), alongside several of his own original tracks, new cut _Speechless_ shows a noticeable step up. Drawing from house beats and the all too familiar slick vocal production that almost guarantees blog features nowadays, it’s an impressive outing and a very promising sign for 2014.",
