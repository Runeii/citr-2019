  "body": "Had this EP from Australia’s **BLOOM** (aka Maddy Herbet) open in a tab for a few days now – and keep on going back to it.\n\nA collection of touching, electronic-pop tracks, that feels mightily mature and coherent for a musician with a relatively limited amount of experience. So there’s a few moments that feel slightly rough round the edges (Bitter Sweet) but there’s also moments of sheer beauty – the highlight being the downright gorgeous _Capture_. Merging elements of Bjork, Purity Ring and London Grammar, it’s an intoxicating listen. Check out a couple of tracks below, and grab the full EP over at [Bandcamp](https://bloommusicofficial.bandcamp.com/releases).\n\n_Please don’t give up on me_\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.\n\n<a href=\"http://bloommusicofficial.bandcamp.com/album/bitter-sweet\">Bitter Sweet by BLOOM</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://bloommusicofficial.bandcamp.com/album/bitter-sweet\">Bitter Sweet by BLOOM</a>",
