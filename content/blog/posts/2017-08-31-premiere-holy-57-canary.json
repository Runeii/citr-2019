  "body": "Stacks of personality on this latest single from London’s **Holy ’57**.\n\nLifted from a forthcoming mini album, there’s a real swing to _Canary,_ merging elements of Broken Social Scene in the melodies and Vampire Weekend-esque lyrics, yet all played out over what comes across as a hip-hop inspired beat.

Check it out below.",
