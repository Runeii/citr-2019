  "body": "Sixteen year old Londoner **Manou** is destined for the big time; I’d be prepared to put money on it.\n\nCurrently working with PNUT (Amy Winehouse, Foxes, Dido), her sonic influences appear far more diverse than you’d imagine at first listen, with her debut track _Sadie_ proving a real early-mid 90’s R&B throwback, pirouetting into a more modern, radio-savvy direction. With a flurry of early, very positive press, it’ll be mightily interesting to watch where this hugely exciting young star goes next. Check out _Sadie_ below.",
