  "body": "**Lapalux**’s debut LP, _Nostalchic_, is just around the corner, due out this month via **Brainfeeder**.\n\n_Forlorn_ wont appear on the album, but is certainly worth a listen on its own merits. To start with, **Busdriver**, goes fucking hard, twisting and turning at an alarming rate around Lapalux’s blissed and serine beat with a remarkable amount of vigour when the speed of his flow is factored in. It’s an accomplishment in itself, yet **Busdriver** also has a lot to stay, speedballing through themes and issues with ease and care. It’s an interesting if not odd pairing, yet certainly welcome all the same.",
