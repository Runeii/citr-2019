After catching the attention of numerous people at SXSW last month, the wave of hype is rapidly gathering behind Mikey Maramag. Showing a more mature, yet still lo-fi influenced sound, Overboard is a magnificent track, held together by a tenderly plucked guitar and a simple but nostalgic beat. The reverb which echoes throughout Overboard adds an extra dimension to the song, allowing it to shimmer elegantly whilst the overlying vocals are soothingly repetitive.
