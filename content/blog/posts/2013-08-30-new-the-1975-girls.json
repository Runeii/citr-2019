  "body": "The second post on **The 1975** in as many days, and anticipation is peaking ahead of the release of their debut LP on Monday.\n\n_Girls_, one of the album’s finest moments, was played on Radio 1 last night, and gives a taster of what’s to follow next week. Surely the next single from the record, it’s gloriously upbeat, and centred around one of those tell-tale 1975 hooks that have helped them on their rise to fame. Check out _Girls_ below, as well as [Influences with The 1975](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/24018-influences-the-1975/), in which Matt talks through some of the driving inspirations behind their LP.",
