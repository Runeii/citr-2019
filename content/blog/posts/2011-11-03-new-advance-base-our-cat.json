  "body": "This is the **Owen Ashworth** that I fell in love with all those years back.\n\nDesperately honest, frightfully relatable and utterly unique. New track _Our Cat_ harks back to _**Etiquette**_\\-years **Casiotone For The Painfully Alone**; a simplistic, sparse beat and a majestic piano with Ashworth’s refined vocals gliding hopelessly over the top. With **Advance Base** set to hit the road this November, it remains to be seen whether a full length record will surface; however until then, let _Our Cat_ tide you over.\n\n [Our Cat (Nov 3, 2011)](http://soundcloud.com/advance-base/our-cat-nov-3-2011) by [Advance Base](http://soundcloud.com/advance-base)  \nTour dates and information available [here](http://www.advancebasemusic.com/).",
