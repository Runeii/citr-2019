  "body": "For the past couple of weeks, the only CD I’ve had in my car has been **The Killers** debut LP, Hot Fuss, an absolute, stone cold classic.\n\nNewport trio The Hearts have clearly spent a decent amount of time with this record as well, given how much it’s rubbed off on their style of polished, anthemic stadium pop-rock. Would they have received more online coverage if their name wasn’t so similar to one of 2014’s breakout stars, Haerts? Possibly, yet as a standalone track, _Lips_ is more than worthy of a mention, even if it still falls a long way short of All These Things That I’ve Done.",
