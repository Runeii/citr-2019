  "body": "Irish whizkid **MMOTHS** is undoubtedly the hottest property amongst young producers at this moment in time.\n\nFrom shows in the states to his debut EP riding high in home country’s charts, his euphoric electronic beats are simultaneously beautiful and poignant. Having seen him play to a packed out venue in Ireland, I can say with confidence that his ethereal live shows are not to be missed, especially in such intimate surroundings. Check out the **Feel Good Lost** directed video for _Thnx_ below, and catch **MMOTHS** at Audio, 11 May (20.15) and Prince Albert, 12 May (12.15).\n\nMore information and tickets for **The Great Escape** [here](http://escapegreat.com/).",
