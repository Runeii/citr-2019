  "body": "‘Oh no, not another surf-pop group!’ I hear you cry.\n\nWith yelps of ‘_I want to run away_‘ and sonnets proclaiming their love for California, San Diego’s **Zoo Dreams** could be perceived as immensely introvert and pretentious, that is if it wasn’t for their knack of writing adorable three minute pop tracks. The project of Scott and Caitlin, their debut EP _**Beginners**_, is a wonderfully upbeat affair, swinging from the jerky guitar line of _We’re All Wandering_ to the lullaby-esque nature of the title track.\n\nComparisons may be drawn to **Best Coast**, yet there’s a more refined edge to **Zoo Dreams**, sounding slicker and less drug-induced. So it verges upon sickly sweet at times (_‘life’s not so bad if you give it some time’_), however I challenge anyone to listen to _Beginners_ and not feel driven to up-sticks and live by the coast for the rest of their days. So whilst we may be swarming with 80’s obsessed surf-pop groups at the moment, there’s certainly room for the mightily impressive **Zoo Dreams**. Check out a couple of choice picks below and grab the full EP on a pay-what-you-like basis from their [bandcamp](http://zoodreams.bandcamp.com/album/beginners-ep).",
