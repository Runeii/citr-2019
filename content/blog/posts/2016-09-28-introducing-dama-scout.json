  "body": "This debut single from Glasgow/London outfit **Dama Scout** showcases colossal potential.\n\nThe production feels perhaps a little raw at times, but the songwriting and ideas are all there. Managing to merge Cocteau Twin levels of gracefulness with a blistering sort of energy usually more associated with the likes of Sleater-Kinney.
