  "body": "With Yoni Wolf’s solo rap tour starting in Arizona today he has released Old Dope, a rap tape featuring some of the finest versification to spill from the artist’s mouth.\n\nStream it below.\n\n<a href=\"http://yoniwolf.bandcamp.com/album/old-dope-rap-tape\">OLD DOPE (RAP TAPE) by Yoni Wolf</a>\n\n**Stand out tracks:** Rappin 4 Money, Jimmy Breeze, Well Water Black (Onyz Coudz Mix), Ghost Dream\n\nOld Dope features reimagined tracks from Yoni Wolf’s current band WHY?, the experimental hiphop group cLOUDEAD and even his early noughtie collaborations with Odd Nosdam as Reaching Quiet.\n\nDespite the slight absurdity of hearing Wolf’s inimitable voice juxtaposed with Mobb Deep and Pharcyde, Old Dope does exactly what its title suggests. The mixtape makes old sounds feel new. Seriously, it’s pretty incredible, especially if you missed some of the amazing lines from cLOUDDEAD and Reaching Quiet the first time around.\n\nFind a list of American tour dates with auspicious wordsmith Serengeti below, or catch up on the latest from Yoni over on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/YoniWolf).\n\nMay 6—Pubrock—Scottsdale, Arizona    \nMay 7—Solar Culture—Tucson, Arizona    \nMay 8—Che Café—La Jolla, California   \nMay 9—The Glass House—Pomona, California    \nMay 10—Echo—Los Angeles, California    \nMay 15—Bottom Of The Hill—Los Angeles, California    \nMay 17—Crepe Place—Santa Cruz, California\n\n_ Featured image is a screengrab from Wedothisnow’s video of Yoni performing White English as an acapella which you can watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1CFLtSu8z0 \"Yoni's White English Acapella\")_",
