  "date": "2012-01-17T22:53:03",
  "body": "One of the hottest young producers of last year **J£ZUS MILLION**, is back with a new cut entitled _That Heat_.\n\nThis track has a real pace and vigor to it, rarely experienced in instrumental hip hop, seemingly taking inspiration from early 00’s trance. It’s pretty unrelenting throughout, with the solid beat tying the entirety of the track together. **J£ZUS MILLION** is on fire, don’t say we didn’t warn you. Check _That Heat_ below.\n\n [That Heat](http://soundcloud.com/jezusmilli/that-heat) by [J£ZUS MILLION](http://soundcloud.com/jezusmilli)",
