  "body": "**Fantasy Rainbow**, or Manchester native Oliver Catt, has some of the best record titles ever.\n\nFact. Most recent effort **_No Hope. Not Ever_** was prefaced by festive single **_It’s Christmas and I Fucking Hate Myself_**. You see where I’m going with this.\n\nWith Girls having topped a bunch of ‘…of the Year’ lists in 2011, and everyone suddenly remembering how fuckin’ rad Dinosaur Jr. were before frantically scouring eBay for a ‘Hi, How Are You?’ t-shirt, self-effacing slack isn’t exactly having a tough time of it right now, but few do it with Catt’s awkward charm and tunefulness. He closed his Great Escape set at the Loft last Saturday with the resigned, Weezer-tinged title track to **_No Hope_**, the video for which is chock-full of appropriate imagery – a lone couple slowdancing in a desolate hall, Catt’s unenthused visage – and is available for your viewing pleasure below. Disengaged has rarely sounded this gorgeous.\n\n[He](http://www.fantasyrainbow.co.uk/ \"He\") [has](http://fantasyrainbow.bandcamp.com/ \"really\") [all](https://twitter.com/#!/FNTSYRNBW \"does,\") [the](https://www.facebook.com/fntsyrnbw \"you\") [sites](http://soundcloud.com/fantasyrainbow \"know.\").",
