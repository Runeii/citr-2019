  "date": "2013-02-15T11:17:25",
  "body": "The weekend is nearly upon us, and with it comes a new cut from **London Grammar**, _Metal & Dust,_ the a-side to their debut 7” single.\n\nThe first leak from the split single, _Hey Now_, took the blog world by storm when it was dropped towards the tail end of last year. _Metal & Dust_ is arguably a better track, the hook, “_we argue we don’t fight/stay awake until the middle of the night_” holds a surprising amount of resonance. We’re all been there of course, now someone’s said it I suppose?\n\n**London’s Grammar**’s debut 7” drops on the 25th of Feb and they’ll be playing Elektrowerkz in London on March 27.",
