While the UK has **Summer Camp** fronted by **Jeremy Warmsley** and his partner **Elizabeth Sankey**, over in Denver Colorado the US have husband and wife duo **Tennis**. **Tennis** comprise ofÂ **Patrick Riley** and **Alaina Moore** and make similar lilting swoon some indie pop. The lo-fi production is evident as the music crackles and scratches against the sweet vocals of **Moore** but this specific track _Marathon_ is really quite glorious coming across like **The Supremes** crossed with **The Vivian Girls**. Not too much is known about this duo and not too much music is available yet but they certainly show great potential.  \nClearly in 2010 the unfashionable virtue of monogamy is very much in evidence in terms of making great music, judging by the sound of **Tennis** this is entirely a good thing.\n\n[Download Marathon](http://www.sendspace.com/file/gvh1ct)\n\n[Check Out Their Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/tennisinc)\n\n[Buy Marathon](http://underwaterpeoples.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=78&Itemid=92)",
