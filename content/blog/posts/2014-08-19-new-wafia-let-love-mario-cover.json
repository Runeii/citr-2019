  "body": "Having made an impact a couple of years back with her debut [self-titled EP](https://wafia.</p><p>bandcamp.com/releases), Brisbane’s **WAFIA** is really starting to make an impact, most notably with a feature on **Japanese Wallpaper’s** [Breathe In](https://soundcloud.com/japanesewallpaper/breathe-in-ft-wafia) a little under a year ago. As well as re-uploading her own original track, _Alice_, she’s also put out a superb cover of Mario’s 2004 classic Let Me Love You. Produced by 23 year old Aussie Jack Vanzet aka [Thrupence](https://soundcloud.com/thrupence), it’s one of the best covers you’ll hear this year. Check it out below, alongside her own track, Alice.",
