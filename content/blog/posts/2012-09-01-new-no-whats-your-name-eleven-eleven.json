  "body": "Since appearing last year with their fantastic debut EP _**Don’t Worry, You’ll Be Here Forever**_, Echo Park six piece **NO** have gathered quite a fanbase, both in their home country and across the pond in the UK.\n\nNow nearly a year on from the release of said EP, they group have returned with a 7″ featuring two new tracks; _What’s Your Name_ and _Eleven Eleven_. Continuing in their ‘post-hymnal’ vein, both are gloriously cinematic – (‘light up the hills with candles, they’re watching us from space’). These are songs made to be played to thousands of screaming fans at the world’s biggest festivals, and it’s only a matter of time before **NO** take to that stage.",
