Stripping the song back to it’s core, in a way that GEMS did with Seal’s [Don’t Cry](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/26345-new-gems-dont-cry-seal-cover/), it’s emotionally fraught, and further indication of just what these guys may well be capable of in the future. Stream it below, and keep up with THIEF on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/thiefthemusic).",
