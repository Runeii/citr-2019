  "body": "Copenhagen’s **Teddy Au Top** appears to have ties to quite a few major EU cities, and it’s perhaps unclear as to whether the project is a duo, or simply that of singer Conor Fitzpatrick.\n\nEither way, his/their debut track, Words, is a promising first outing, minimal in a similar vein to someone like George Maple yet hinting at the possibility of branching out into a full on dance track, not too far from Disclosure or Tourist in truth. Check out _Words_ below.",
