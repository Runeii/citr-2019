  "body": "Friday 28th May saw **Slow Club**, supported by **Summer Camp**, grace the stage at the recently opened **FAC251** club  in Manchester.\n\nFor those of you who aren’t aware of the history of **FAC251**, it is contained within the building that once housed the infamous Mancunian record label **Factory Records**. A project led by **Peter Hook** and **Ben Kelly** saw the building redeveloped and transformed into a stylish club that now hosts regular club nights and occasional live gigs. Therefore with such a history behind **FAC251**, one could have expected **Slow Club** and **Summer Camp** to show some sign of nerves performing to what turned out to be a packed audience. However even if these nerves were ever felt, they were definitely not shown in a gig with two fantastically performed sets.\n\nThe gig began with **Summer Camp** emerging from the audience and, with an unassuming and simple introduction, they began their set. Unfortunately due to the horrific and untimely death of my pen (there was ink everywhere), I wasn’t able to record the set lists of both **Summer Camp** and **Slow Club**, so I will unfortunately have to talk in generalities. Before going to the gig I had heard a significant amount of **Summer Camp**‘s music, especially after interviewing them a little while back (see link below). Their dreamy synth-pop immediately caught my attention and, most importantly, held it. The vocals of **Elizabeth Sankey** and **Jeremy Warmsley** are woven with a peaceful passion, while also acting as the driving force behind every track. However I wondered whether this sound, which had caused me to leave these tracks on repeat for days, could be transferred to a live setting without the dreamy synths being subjected to the harsh awakening of a noisy yet cavernous room.\n\nAny doubts I had were immediately dispelled. Now despite the pen fiasco, I can tell you that the set opened with **Ghost Train**. I was immediately taken in by the track the same way I was when I first heard it on their Myspace, especially as **Sankey**‘s vocals fortunately did not lose any of their serene charm in a live setting. However while I was bordering on entering a state of musically induced hypnosis, I took the time to judge the reaction of the rest of the audience. Underwhelmed seemed to be the unfortunate consensus. This was somewhat reflected in **Summer Camp**‘s performance, with each track simply rolled into another without pause or interlude, knowing most of the audience had bought their tickets in anticipation of **Slow Club**. However this subdued set was endearing towards **Summer Camp**, as there was not a trace of egotistical pomp in their whole performance. Instead, as each track was played, there was a slight but definite feeling of a gaining interest and enjoyment in the audience, all of whom were experiencing, to varying degrees, the feeling of pleasant hypnosis that I swiftly returned to.\n\nObviously new to performing as a live band, **Summer Camp** presented themselves as professional yet fun, and refined yet with a raw originality. They played a great deal of their small yet growing catalogue, with **Round the Moon** and **Was It Worth It?** particular highlights. I was even fortunate enough to have **Elizabeth** sing straight at me, which was only topped by her unnecessary yet amusing apology afterwards!\n\nStartlingly, my **Summer Camp** hypnosis was disrupted by the beginning of **Slow Club**‘s set. Without warning, **Slow Club** played their first track without microphones or amps in the middle of the crowd. This, unsurprisingly, drew the audience’s attention immediately and set the tone for the rest of a set that appeared to rid itself of the ‘fourth wall’. Each track appeared tailored to the audience, with the slow and the sombre balanced finely with the upbeat and enthusiastic. **Slow Club**‘s greater experience of performing live was seen immediately with their more comfortable demeanor on stage, and each track performed was  undoubtedly classic **Slow Club**. However the highlight of their set, barring the rather gentile stage invader, was the introduction of members of **Summer Camp** for the final few songs. Again due to the pen fiasco I cannot report to you the titles of these tracks, however I can assure you it was the perfect climax to a set filled with a reverberating energy.\n\nOn rereading I have realised I’ve attributed a disproportionate amount of reporting to **Summer Camp**. This could be due to the scary possibility that the hypnosis I experienced was in fact real, and that, through music, **Summer Camp** had already embedded in my mind what I would write. However I think the more likely, and sadly less imaginative, reason is that many of you will have already heard **Slow Club** and no doubt experienced their fantastic live sets many times. Therefore I think it far wiser to tell you that **Summer Camp** are a new and exciting musical entity, and they proved this at **FAC251** on Friday 28th May.\n\n[Summer Camp Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/summercampmusic)  \n[Slow Club Myspace](www.myspace.com/slowclub)  \n[Summer Camp Interview](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/uncategorized/699-5-minutes-with-summer-camp)",
