  "body": "Moving slightly away from the Grimes influenced sound that dominated their impressive debut track, _Samurai_, Florida trio **X Priest X** channel more of an M83 vibe on latest track _Dark Sun_.\n\nStill in ‘demo’ form, no doubt a decision made that will allow them to retreat to a studio at some point, and put finishing touches to the track, it’s bolder and more stadium ready than their previous outing, yet no less impressive. Check it out below.",
