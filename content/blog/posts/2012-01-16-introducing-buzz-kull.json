  "body": "Duo’s seem to be all the rage at the moment, and Sydney’s **Buzz Kull** are no exception.\n\nComprised of **Marcel Whyler** and **Rebecca Liston**, their claustrophobic ‘doomwave’ is . industrial, disconsolate and enterprisingly intimidating. It’s sort of how I’d imagine the lovechild of **The XX** and **The Horrors** to sound, providing it had been starved of ever hearing a number one single.Their debut three tracks carve a very singular notch for the duo, building shallow, desolate caves in which they thrive. Whilst the vocals could perhaps do with slightly more production at times, the likes of _Fallen Flower_ and _I Disappear_ have limitless potential, that hopefully, will be fulfilled. Check out _Fallen Flower_ below and hit up their [bandcamp](http://buzzkull.bandcamp.com/track/i-disappear) for free downloads of their tree debut tracks.\n\n [Fallen Flower](http://soundcloud.com/buzzkull/fallen-flower) by [Buzz Kull](http://soundcloud.com/buzzkull)",
