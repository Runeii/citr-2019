  "date": "2014-02-12T19:29:30",
  "body": "**Daniel Wilson** is quite rightly beginning to gain the recognition that his songwriting and fantastic vocals deserve.\n\n_Please Dream Again_, lifted from his forthcoming EP, _**Young Rubbish**_, is more experimental than _Will You_, which earned him praise towards the end of last year, harking back more to the initial Soundcoud demos that put him onto our radar. Layering his soulful vocals with dreamy, otherworldly synths, **Wilson** is rapidly proving he’s one to watch in 2014.",
