Embodying the spirit of **Weezer** with the gritty, fuzz laden tunes of **Wavves**, the Florida four piece are rapidly becoming one of my favourite new acts of 2011. Their new video for _Outta’ Know_ is a vibrantly colourful affair, documenting the group performing the track in a cramped studio space, and still managing to have a raucous time. Shot in front of an ever changing backdrop of disco-inspired colours, it’s simplicity in it’s most enjoyable form. You get the impression that you could stick these guys in a room together with nothing but their equipment, and they’d still have the time of their lives, and possibly even write a few anthemic tracks. Check out the video for _Outta’ Know_ below.\n\n[Michael Christmas – Outta’ Know](http://vimeo.com/32298007) from [ryan zarra](http://vimeo.com/rcz) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
