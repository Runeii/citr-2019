  "body": "Having announced himself with the rousing [Cold Blood](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/22101-introducing-farewell-dear-ghost/), Austria’s **Farewell Dear Ghost** aka 23 year old Philipp Szalay returns with his debut single proper, _Fade Out_, backed with B-side _Tremble_. The A-side is a straight up pop-rock anthem in waiting, complete with a call-to-arms chorus and early 00’s indie guitar riff, however it’s the flip-side that really interests me. A tender, heartfelt number, channeling **Youth Lagoon** from a slightly slicker, dare I say more mainstream perspective. Check out both below.",
