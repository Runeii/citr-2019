  "body": "London outfit, **Gossip Column** impressed last year with their debut track _The Beginning Of Everything_, earning rave reviews from Gold Flake Paint.\n\nThey return in 2015 with their sophomore release, _Medical Medley_, a pensive and melancholic three minutes that enthrals from start to finish. The drifting, crooning vocals are restrained and dreary, encasing the entire track in a beautifully somber haze that refuses to let go. It isn’t until the closing section when the lyrics “I haven’t thought for you for days” shower the track with the welcomed optimism of moving on. Stream _Medical Medley_ below:",
