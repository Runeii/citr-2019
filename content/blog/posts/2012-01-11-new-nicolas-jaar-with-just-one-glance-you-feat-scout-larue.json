  "body": "Up until [Gorilla vs Bear](http://www.gorillavsbear.net/2012/01/11/mp3-nicolas-jaar-with-just-one-glance/) pointed everyone in the right direction, this new cut from **Nicolas Jaar** went somewhat under the radar. Featuring vocals from **Scout Larue**, the daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, it’s seemingly picks up where **Jaar** left off on **Darkside**. Whilst the sampled vocals underneath hark back to **Space Is Only Noise**, the minimal, languid production points to a future, darker sound. Try telling me you aren’t falling in love. Check out _With Just One Glance You_ below.\n\n [Nicolas Jaae – With Just One Glance You (Feat.
