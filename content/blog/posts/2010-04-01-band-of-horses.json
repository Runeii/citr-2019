As always, Bridwell’s voice is fantastic, however it is not quite up to the high standard they set on Everything All The Time and Cease To Begin, and after listening to it I couldn’t help feeling that the song finishes just as it starts to get going. I still have high expectations for the album, entitled Infinite Arms released May 18th.\n\nCompliments is avaliable as a free download by signing up to the Band Of Horses mailing list at [http://bandofhorses.com/](http://bandofhorses.com/)",
