Made available via The National’s facebook page, Every Night My Teeth Are Falling Out takes their sound in the exact direction the band have been hinting at. In an interview with Pitchfork they suggested that new record Burst Apart is more a kin to their live performances than 2009’s Hospice, featuring harsher, bolder guitars with greater emphasis on the vocals. There’s far less fragility exposed on both new tracks showcased so far, and one gets the feeling this may be setting the tone for the entirity of Burst Apart.
