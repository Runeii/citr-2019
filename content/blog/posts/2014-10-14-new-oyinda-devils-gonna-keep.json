  "body": "**Oyinda’s** [What Still Remains](http://admin.</p><p>crackintheroad.com/music/29713-introducing-oyinda) endures as one of my favourite singles of 2014; powerful vocals, an intricate storytelling ability and an ear for a killer hook showcase exactly why she’s one of this years finest new artists. Her latest single, and third available track, _The Devil’s Gonna Keep Me_, is another example of her spellbinding poetic nature – “_I hear a whisper as the silence spoke / the devil’s gonna keep me_“. Another self-produced number, it’s further indication that 2015 is already shaping up to be rather special for Oyinda. Check it out below.",
