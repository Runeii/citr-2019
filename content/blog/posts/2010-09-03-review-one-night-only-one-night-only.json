Not only was their first album as dull as Daniel Radcliffe’s acting, lead singer **George Craig** somehow managed to end up as the partner of the ravishing Emma Watson. So aside from besmirching charts with their turgid music, stealing my dream girl and having a first name for a surname… well they’ve done nothing wrong.\n\nSo you’ll be as surprised as any to hear that I actually like _Say You Don’t Want It_; the new single from the guys. Fusing anthemic guitars with infectious synths, **One Night Only** appeared to have found themselves a much improved sound. Albeit, it’s nothing that hasn’t been done before, and arguably better by **The Lightning Seeds**, however it’s a vast improvement on the droll that polluted the charts in 2008. The sole problem I have with the song is the atrocious video, featuring Miss Hermione Granger herself, but that’s possibly just loathsome jealously on my part.\n\nAfter hearing _Say You Don’t Want It_, I hesitantly yet slightly optimistically decided to give their new self titled (second album being self titled, who do they think they are? **Razorlight**? **The Libertines?**) album a spin, in the hope of unearthing more pop gems. However, after one listen I knew this was unfortunately not to be, the band instantaneously return to their formulaic indie pop by numbers. The lyrics are abysmally crafted, “_where am I supposed to go, I’m hoping that you won’t say no_” on _Chemistry_ is as good an example as any. If these words are the love potion he used to woo Miss Watson, maybe she’s not as clever as her Gryffindor points let on\n\nThere are indie love songs aplenty, _Never Be The Same_ could comfortably be a **Scouting For Girls** song, “_and with all these clouds high above you, I guess it’s going to rain_” purrs Craig, in a manner so saccharine it’s sickening, and that’s coming from someone with a sweet tooth. _Nothing Left_ appears to have walked straight off the set of the Disney Channel, complete with sappy “uplifting” chorus and words to singalong to at the bottom of the screen. Album closer _Can’t Stop Now_ uses the exhausted formula: synths + indie pop band = hit single, sorry guys, but we’re tired of it. “Aww,” I hear you snivel, “don’t pick on the nice pretty boys from **One Night Only**“, I’m not. They are not the only perpetrators of abominably repulsive indie pop by numbers, however this recent album shows they are setting out a good case to claim the crown to be the worst of a bad bunch.\n\nLet me not take anything away from the lead single though; it’s a future anthem in waiting, a catchy hook, meaningless but flowing lyrics and a chorus to charm the most vexatious heart. However the rest of the album is nothing worth shouting about, unless of course you are shouting to drown out this garbage that calls itself music, in which case you are forgiven. After an entire listen to this record, I can wholeheartedly say the only track that might ever feature again on my iPod is _Say You Don’t Want It_, even then, I’d be far more inclined to stick on **Like You Do**. Singalong with me now “_I’m sinking deep, I’m going under…!_”\n\n[Check Out One Night Only’s Myspace!](http://www.myspace.com/onenightonlyonline)",
