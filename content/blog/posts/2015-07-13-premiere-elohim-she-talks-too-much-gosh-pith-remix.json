  "body": "Last month, LA’s **Elohim** dropped one of the most impressive debut tracks of the year, with her CHVRCHES meets bubblegum pop future hit _She Talks Too Much_.\n\nHitting half a million plays on Spotify and smashing the Hype Machine charts, even in the internet age, it’s rare that a debut outing receives such overwhelming positive feedback. Not only a killer track in it’s own right, it also feels prime for remixing, with a couple of  reworks already appearing since release. This dance floor ready edit comes courtesy of rising Detroit duo GOSH PITH, layering the addictive synth hook with phenomenal results. Check it out below and pre-order the release [here](http://b3scirecords.bigcartel.com/product/b3sr-025-elohim-she-talks-too-much-xanax).",
