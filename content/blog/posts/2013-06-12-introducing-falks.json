  "body": "From what I can gather from their [tumblr](http://thesoundoffalks.tumblr.com/), LA’s **FALKS** are a duo, partially comprised of [AKW](https://www.facebook.com/akwmusic) member **Alex Wisner**. With a suspended [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thesoundoffalks) account, and a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/thesoundoffalks) profile with only two likes (presumably the two girls that make up **FALKS**); information is perhaps purposefully scarce. The three tracks online so far, taken from a release (quite possible an EP) titled **I Got Cold**, showcases a fragile yet exquisitely self-assured side to the duo. Take the opening track _I Feel Nothing / At Night Part I & II_, an introspective, tearful ballad, blending elements of CitR favourite Eddi Front with the raw, early demos of Laura Marling. Blending what I assume are film/TV samples with their own music, in a manner that would make Conor Oberst proud, before slipping gracefully into the line, ‘_at night when I see the moon, I know it’s the same one you see too’_.\n\nCheck out the beautiful video for _Ira_ below, and the full EP underneath that.",
