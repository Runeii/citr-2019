  "body": "So synth-pop duos/trios are definitely all the rage right now, with the likes of CHVRCHES, Purity Ring and Broods leading the way, it’s an exciting time for electronic-pop music right now.\n\nLA trio **MOOD ROBOT** (Alex Kazenoff, Ben Kazenoff and Kelly Mickel), shine on their self-titled EP, a delightful mix of slightly cheesey 80’s inspirations, and even a touch of the now seemingly defunct tag, ‘chillwave’. EP highlight, Singin’ Like I’m Crazy definitely slides towards the sickly sweet end of the scale, yet the intelligent production and powerful vocals of Mickel stop it straying into synth-pop dross territory. Check out the full EP below.",
