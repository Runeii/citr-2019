  "body": "London via Belgium duo **Mannequins on 7th Street** kicked up quite a fuss at the tail end of last year with their two debut tracks Sofia and Wailing of Hesione attracting interest from several top blogs.\n\nHitting the ground running in 2014, the two piece have just released their latest effort, the silkily luxurious _Out of Sight_. Littered with sparse, fragmented percussion sections and the pitch perfect vocals that characterised their debut outings, it’s another suggestion that Mannequins on 7th Street could be set for an important year.",
