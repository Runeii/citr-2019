After forming in 1996, it took them 5 years for their debut album to be released, but it was well worth the wait, reaching number 5 in the album charts, providing 2 hit singles and earning themselves a Mercury Nomination. However, it has been anything but clean sailing for the band since then. Falling out with record labels and arguments amongst the band made it difficult for them to produce anything of consistent quality, despite releasing three albums since their debut in 2001 and the release of their _Singles Collection_ in 2008. After several albums of mediocrity, _Butterfly House_ is a welcome return to form, soaring guitar riffs and Beatles influenced melodic layered vocals, set this track up as a perfect summer tune. After spending years in the shadow of other bands, hopefully 2010 will be their best year so far for **The Coral**, and this free download from the bandâ€™s official site is a positive indication that they may finally be fulfilled the potential shown on their debut.\n\n[Download from Official Site](www.thecoral.co.uk)\n\n[Alternative Link](http://www.mediafire.com/?lm3uqlzmzdz)",
