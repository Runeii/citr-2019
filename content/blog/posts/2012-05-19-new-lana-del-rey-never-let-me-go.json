  "body": "It’s been a while since we last heard from everyone’s favourite pouty-lipped princess, and it appears she may have been working on new material in that time.\n\nThis delightful new ballad titled _Never Let Me Go_ feels far more like her original demos than the tracks which formed her debut album _**Born To Die**_. It’s all 60’s guitars, violin swoons and tinkling pianos, enough to win over even the most ardent **Del Rey** hater. Lyrically it’s stereotypical **Lana**, quoting Scarface and harking on about ‘bad boys’ and living fast/dying young, but hey, you know the score by now right?\n\nKudos to [Disco Naivete](http://disconaivete.com/) for the heads up.",
