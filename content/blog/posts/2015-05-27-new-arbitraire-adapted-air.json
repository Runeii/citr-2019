  "date": "2015-05-27T15:06:09",
  "body": "As far as debuts go, **Arbitraire’s** first offering is pretty impressive.\n\nOnly giving their first names (Andrea, Genji and Adrian) and no location (obviously, this is the internet), Adapted Air merges elements of modern funk, with the sort of soulful electronica that propelled Massive Attack to worldwide stardom. Wonderfully atmospheric, and building to a stunning finale, it’s a beautiful introduction.\n\nEDIT: Perhaps not their debut as such, check out another track, Love Will Be, underneath.\n\nFollow our [Spotify On Repeat playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a hand-picked selection of the current hottest tracks.",
