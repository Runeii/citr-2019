  "date": "2012-10-16T19:29:41",
  "body": "**Novella** have always made tunes that are broad, both in terms of expression and the clear genre inspiration they conceive from.\n\nTheir new track however, **_Mary’s Gun_**, is remarkably minute in both its story telling and observations. The track centres around **Shangri-Las** lead singer Mary Weiss and her encounters with the FBI, that eventually lead to Mary carrying a gun; voila, we have a song title. Not a bad track to start a small UK tour with; check their upcoming dates below.\n\n**_Mary’s Gun_** will be released on Italian Beach Babes on 26th November.\n\nOCTOBER  \n17 Take 5, Norwich  \n18 Louisiana, Bristol  \n19 Sound Control, Manchester\n\nNOVEMBER  \n16 The End Fest, Flashback Records, London  \n17 The Old Blue Last, London  \n30 Sixty Million Postcards, Bournemouth",
