  "date": "2012-03-30T16:02:53",
  "body": "Photo credit: Julien Bourgeois\n\nYou don’t need me to tell you again just how special **MONEY** are.\n\nWith the previously released _Goodnight London_ selling out within days of being made available, new single _SOLONG (GODISDEAD)_ is destined for the same fate. There’s an ethereal, hauntingly beautiful aspect to **MONEY’s** music that is fascinatingly difficult to place, and even harder to replicate. Touches of **Sigur Ros** and **James Blake** creep in at times, yet ultimately, they’re completely unique and utterly devastating. _SOLONG (GODISDEAD)_ is released on 14 May on [Almost Musique](http://www.almost-musique.com/2012/03/money-solonggodisdead/).\n\nVia ([No Fear of Pop](http://nofearofpop.net/2012/03/video-premiere-money-solong-godisdead/))",
