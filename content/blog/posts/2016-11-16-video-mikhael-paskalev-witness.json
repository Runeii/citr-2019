  "body": "This video from Liverpool’s **Mikhael Paskalev** is up there with the finest visuals I’ve seen this year.\n\nThe sheer ambition of the video is short film worthy; hell, if it was longer I’d definitely watch the full thing. By the time the track itself kicks in, around the 2.30 mark, you’ll be well and truly engrossed. Words barely do justice to the beauty and brilliance of this video. Check it out below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
