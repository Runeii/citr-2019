  "body": "When it comes to reworking female vocals, there are few artists around better at it than **Sacred Animals** aka Wexford’s Darragh Nolan.\n\nThis collaboration with Ohio’s **Pretty Heart** feels so natural, offering up an alternative take on the original released at the tail end of last year. Using **Morgan Holliger’s** vocals to illustrious effect, it’s a spacious, dream-pop spin, twisting the Bat For Lashes balladry of the original into something equally as beautiful.",
