Thankfully their new single _‘Tighten Up’_ falls under the former, seeing them return to form. The sound is remarkably cleaner, gone is the typical **Black Keys** gravel, in its place is a more soulful groove filled sound. **Dan Auerbach’s** voice as always is agonisingly passionate and moulds perfectly with the new direction. Although a new direction for the band _‘Tighten Up’_ is by no means revolutionary, however the catchy and of course passionate sound will still have you tapping your foot.\n\n[Download Tighten Up](http://rapidshare.com/files/383483454/The_Black_Keys_-_Tighten_Up.mp3)\n\n[The Black Key’s Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/theblackkeys)",
