  "body": "If there’s one positive we can take from the untimely demise of WU LYF, it’s that it’s brought what were previously side-projects to the forefront, with Francis Lung, Los Porcos, and Ménage à Trois all stepping up to the limelight in recent months.\n\nThis beautiful live performance of UB40’s _Don’t Break My Heart_ by trio **Ménage à Trois** adds further evidence to the claim that they’re one of the most exciting new acts in the UK. With a couple of covers and a handful of original tracks now kicking about online, it’s becoming clear that the Manchester outfit are big fans of the crooners, not only that but with as with WU LYF, there’s a real attempt to craft a narrative, in both the music and the creative approach. Check out their version of _Don’t Break My Heart_, filmed live at Manchester Art Gallery.",
