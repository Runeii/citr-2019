  "body": "Been a while since we checked in with KC’s **Soft Lighting** – who has been busy laying down a new release featuring production from A$AP P on the boards – an unlikely but brilliant collaboration.\n\n_Avalanche_, the latest single, is lifted from a new EP out at the end of the month, and feels like an out-take from the Drive soundtrack. Swirling 80’s synths, shoegaze inspired vocals alongside some immaculate production really set this track out as one of the most ambitious, addictive singles of the year thus far. Check it out below.\n\nLike this?
