  "body": "Having made a name for himself with his explosive one-man-band live shows, **Jack Garratt** has unveiled his first single of the year, in the form of the Zane Lowe premiered _Chemical_.\n\nSticking to the slightly odd-pop formula that defined his early EP releases, it’s arguably his most ambitious single to date, whilst being seemingly perfect for the festival crowds that no doubt await. Expect some heavy radio play and big remixes for this, set to feature on his new EP _The Synesthesiac _out 13 April. Check it out below.",
