  "body": "Slick, R&B infused pop from LA outfit **M o t h e r** is proving pretty hot right now.\n\nWith a Neon Gold show lined up for Friday with **Scavenger Hunt** and **Magic Man**, you can bet that industry types will be out in force, and judging from the strength of this track, quite rightly so. _Easy_ is a funky, vaguely 80’s feeling ‘jam’, sensual and highly addictive. Check it out below, and if you live in LA, check them out at The Echo.",
