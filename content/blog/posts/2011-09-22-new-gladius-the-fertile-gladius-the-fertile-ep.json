  "date": "2011-09-22T21:02:34",
  "body": "As a release, [**Gladius the Fertile**’s](http://gladiusthefertile.bandcamp.com/) debut EP does its very best to polarise what it means to be a bedroom producer. From the record’s stance on beauty to its epic scope, it pushes more than ever what’s possible from the confinements of a small 4 walled room. The EP that was released today is full of lush guitar strings and warm melodies that consume the listener, but in a way that at times is comforting and gratifying. Take  ‘**_Bird Chip_**’ and its delicate and mild whistling riff. Yet on the other hand we’re presented with something far darker, harsh and mutated vocal sacrifices punctuate and inflame certain tracks, giving the record a more menacing edge.\n\nStream and download the EP below.",
