  "body": "With an album on the way, and one of this years[ essential EP’s](www.</p><p>crackintheroad.com/music/30380-2014-40-essential-eps-2014-part) already under their belts, rest assured that **Wolf Alice** are launching themselves head first into 2015. This new video, as part of Vevo DSCVR’s Ones to Watch series, has them performing a previously unheard track, the snarling, Queens of the Stoneage-esque _Giant Peach_. Combining the frenetic energy of their live sets with the songwriting abilities and group cohesion that have already made them one of the UK’s best live bands, it’s a mere taster of what is sure to be a mighty year for the quartet.",
