  "body": "Suffolk’s **The Soft** have set the blogging community alight in the space of a couple of days.\n\nThe trio comprised of **Henry Morris**, **Zander Fletcher** and **William Glass** released their debut EP _**Hot Summer**_ yesterday, and it’s already been on the receiving end of rave reviews. With it’s otherworldly sounds and organic ambient nature, it’s kind of like **Balam Acab** meets **Baths**. The softly delivered vocals add a welcome layer of emotion to the tracks, such as the stunning _Half Breath_ with it’s barely audible lyrics. Elsewhere on the EP the seven minute epic _Venus Breath_ is wonderfully atmospheric, with it’s dreamy vocals and trance influenced synths, and EP closer _Orphius_ is gorgeously entrancing, seducing the listener into a sensual lull.\n\nWith the EP available as a free download from **The Soft’s** [bandcamp](http://thesoft.bandcamp.com/) page, and a rapidly growing fanbase, you can guarantee that this won’t be the last we hear of the Suffolk trio. Check out a couple of cuts below.\n\n [Half Breath](http://soundcloud.com/thesoft/half-breath) by [The Soft](http://soundcloud.com/thesoft)  \n [Venus Breath](http://soundcloud.com/thesoft/venus-breath) by [The Soft](http://soundcloud.com/thesoft)",
