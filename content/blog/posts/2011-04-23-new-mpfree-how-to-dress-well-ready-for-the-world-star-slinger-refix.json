Two of my favourite artists; Mancunian beat maker **Star Slinger** remixing Brooklyn lo-fi artist **How To Dress Well**, it’s a match made in heaven. Both artists have been a mainstay over on the Pitchfork site for the last year, and this new remix of **How To Dress Well’s** _Ready For The World_ will undoubtedly appear on their site within the next few hours. Darren’s midas touch turns the ethereal beauty of Ready For The World into a far more hip hop driven gem. A dubstep influenced beat underpins the entire track, whilst **How To Dress Well’s** vocals glide over the top of it elegantly. Listen and download below.\n\n [How To Dress Well – Ready For The World (Star Slinger Refix)](http://soundcloud.com/starslingeruk/how-to-dress-well-ready-for) by [Star Slinger](http://soundcloud.com/starslingeruk)",
