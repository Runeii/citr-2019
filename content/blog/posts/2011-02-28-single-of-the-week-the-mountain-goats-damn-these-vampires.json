The first release from the album ‘_Damn these vampires_’ is heavy on story and seems to have peaked interest in a band that although releasing a lot of albums has so far failed to receive the attention they deserve. Check out the tune below and stream the album if you’re feeling freaky. You’re feeling freaky right?\n\n [The Mountain Goats – Damn These Vampires](http://soundcloud.com/indiespot/the-mountain-goats-damn-these-vampires) by [Indiespot](http://soundcloud.com/indiespot)  \n[](http://www.npr.org/2011/02/27/134056034/first-listen-the-mountain-goats-all-eternals-deck)\n\n[Stream the album here](http://www.npr.org/2011/02/27/134056034/first-listen-the-mountain-goats-all-eternals-deck)",
