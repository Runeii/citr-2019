  "body": "Another graduate of CitR’s Sound of 2012 list, Irish producer **REID** has well and truly cemented his name as one of the most exciting young artists around at the moment.\n\nWith half a dozen original tracks and remixes to his name, it’s not hard to fathom just why we predicted that this year would be vitally important to his career. New track _Miami_ premiered via [XLR8R](http://www.xlr8r.com/mp3/2012/04/miami) earlier today continues in a similar vein to previous outings, slightly dark, understated dance music, perfect to soundtrack late night drives. Check out _Miami_ below.",
