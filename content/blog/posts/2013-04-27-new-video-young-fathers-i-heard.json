  "body": "After the highs and lows of the first CITR LIVE party, we’re having to play catch-up.\n\nThis new cut, taken from **Young Fathers’** second tape entitled _Tape Two,_ due out in June via Anticon, takes the bands dusty and damaged visual persona and drags it kicking and screaming into an even more dramatic and fully realised space.
