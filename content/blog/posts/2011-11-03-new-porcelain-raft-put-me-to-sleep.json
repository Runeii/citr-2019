  "body": "With his debut album _**Strange Weekend**_ due out at the end of January, **Mauro Remiddi** aka **Porcelain Raft** has dropped a new track in the form of _Put Me To Sleep_.\n\nHaving spent 27 years traveling around Europe, it’s fair to say that Remiddi isn’t short of life experience, and it’s a quality that shines through predominantly in his music. _Put Me To Sleep_ is dream-pop at it’s utmost idyllic, softly near-whispered vocals, catchy hooks and effervescent synths. _**Strange Weekend**_ will be released through Secretly Canadian on 23 January 2011, the track listing is below, alongside his currently confirmed tour support slots with **M83**.
