  "body": "So after almost two years off, Brooklyn indie band The National are back with new album High Violet, released May 10th.\n\nThe first single from the album is Bloodbuzz Ohio and is available for free download from the bands website, just by entering your email address. It is a fantastic comeback single, although not too far from the sound they achieved on 2007’s Boxer, Matt Berninger’s vocals are immaculate. Berninger mourns “I never married, but Ohio don’t remember me”. They will still recieve lazy comparisons to Joy Division, however in my opinion, Bloodbuzz Ohiois far more comparable to Echo & The Bunnymen, especially the music which accompanies Berninger’s singing.\n\n[Official Website](http://www.americanmary.com/)  \n[Alternative Link](http://www.mediafire.com/?zy0ynijzmyw)",
