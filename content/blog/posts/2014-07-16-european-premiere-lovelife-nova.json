  "body": "Fresh from a run of US shows with Ellie Goulding, LA-via-London quartet **Lovelife** return right in time for the stereotypically short-lived British summer.\n\nBolder and more adventurous then ever before, _Nova_ is undoubtedly one of this years most anthemic tracks, ready made for party playlists. Equal parts elegant and ferocious; showcasing the pinnacle of their songwriting thus far, it’s easy to see why they’re winning over fans in colossal numbers on both sides of the Atlantic. With official remixes for [Gaga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ic8U0MRHGM) and [Imagine Dragons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnrfTPoYqKo) under their belts, alongside a mightily impressive live show, Lovelife look set to grab hold of 2014 in a way that few bands have done thus far. Check out Nova below, and grab a download immediately from iTunes, as well as a free download of previous single, _Angel_.",
