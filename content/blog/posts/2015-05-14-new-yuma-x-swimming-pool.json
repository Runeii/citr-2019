  "body": "What with all the awesome electronic music coming out of Australia over the course of the past couple of years (we’re talking Klo, Autumn, Tora etc.\n\n), it was only a matter of time before one of the acts really nailed it, and Aussie duo **Yuma X** (Lucy & Jake) have done just that, on their debut _Swimming Pool_.
