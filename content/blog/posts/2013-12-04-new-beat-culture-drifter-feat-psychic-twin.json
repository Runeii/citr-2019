  "body": "Photo: Landon Speers\n\nIt feels like an age since **Beat Culture** released his debut album, [Tokyo Dreamer](http://beatculture.bandcamp.com/album/tokyo-dreamer); two years sure do fly by. Aside from a [collaboration](https://soundcloud.com/beat-culture/slow-magic-beat-culture-once) with Slow Magic at the turn of 2012 and a handful of shows, Sunik Kim has remained relatively quiet, working on new material, with new track _Drifter_ showing off the fruits of his labour. Featuring Brooklyn’s Erin Fein aka [**Psychic Twin**](http://psychictwin.bandcamp.com/) on vocals, it sticks to the intimacy that made his earliest work so listenable, whilst throwing in hints of breaking out into an over-the-top pop number. Check out _Drifter_ below.",
