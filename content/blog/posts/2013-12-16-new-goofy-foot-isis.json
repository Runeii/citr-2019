  "body": "One of those times where you’re so blurred with excitement and want to write so much about the song and the artist in question but the only thing that comes up is… well…nothing.\n\nThis is what happened to me with **[Goofy Foot](https://www.facebook.com/GOOFYFOOTSD)‘s** **Isis**. A Californian producer and vocalist that blends the old and new with an ease that quite frankly leaves you speechless. **Isis** is bluesy in vocals, ingenious in sampling, soulful in heart, groovy in vibes, explosive in its core and so grandiose in its production that it awoke all the senses in the same way that **[Jungle](https://www.facebook.com/jungle4eva)‘s ****Platoon.** So, if you’re looking for something to burst into 2014 that might be **Spencer Jarrad**‘s **[Goofy Foot](https://www.facebook.com/GOOFYFOOTSD).**\n\n**Goofy Foot EP** is available for free download at his [bandcamp page](http://goofyfoot.bandcamp.com/).\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/117317744″ params=”color=ff6600&auto\\_play=false&show\\_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]",
