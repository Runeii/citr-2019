  "body": "![](http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/500/43345523/unouomedude++3.png \"UNO\")After writing one of the catchiest tracks of last year in the form of the gloriously extravagant Island Summer, Jacksonville based indie pop artist unouomedude is back with a couple of new tracks. Frequency I & II, two takes of the same track, are both available to download for free from his bandcamp, and continue where 2010’s EP Marsh left off. Reverb soaked guitars combined with elements of twee inspired lyrics turn this tracks into two entirely different perfectly crafted pop masterpieces. Personally Frequency II works slightly better, coming across as more atmospheric and the underlying beat holds the track together expertly. On the other hand, Frequency I whilst still being a good track, feels almost like a Wavves b-side, fuzzy yet logical in it’s composition. Head over to [unouomedude’s bandcamp](http://unouomedude.bandcamp.com/album/frequency-7) to download both tracks!",
