  "body": "Haunted Hearts is the husband and wife duo of **Dum Dum Girls’** Dee Dee Penny and **Crocodiles’ **Brandon Welch. The video for new cut _Johnny Jupiter_ is all colour, psychedelia and androgyny and is certainly a fitting background to the track. Drifting along at a dream like pace for the full four minutes and fifteen seconds, _Johnny Jupiter_ doesn’t really go anywhere, but it feels like an instant and an eternity all at the same time. Mesmerising stuff…\n\nCheck out the visuals for _Johnny Jupiter_ above and catch **Crocodiles** supporting **Dum Dum Girls** across the UK in May.",
