  "body": "Since stumbling across **Rossi’s** magnificent debut track [Ossetia](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14429-new-rossi-ossetia/) a couple of weeks back, I’ve been cautiously awaiting more new music, and their second offering _War Within_ doesn’t disappoint. A delectable acoustic number, it’s fragile yet somehow completely overwhelming, with **Kendall Morgan’s** vocals proving utterly stunning as she yearns for understanding _“barefoot in the snow, where am i to go, when everything beneath me melts”_. Once can be chance, but twice is an undeniable assertion of genuine talent, and Rossi have that in abundance. Check out _War Within_ below.\n\n<a href=\"http://rossi.bandcamp.com/track/war-within\">War Within by Rossi</a>",
