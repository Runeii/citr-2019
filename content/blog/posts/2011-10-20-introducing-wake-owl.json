  "body": "_Wild Country_, the debut single from Vancouver based singer/songwriter [**Wake! Owl**](http://www.facebook.com/wakeowl) is a valiantly composed affair. The popular folk influences, such as Bon Iver and My Morning Jacket are blatant but not over-empowering, with **Colyn Cameron’s** tender vocals being a particular highlight. Lyrically, it’s smile inducing and poetic, but not earth-shatteringly moving, however it more than fulfills its modest intentions. With his debut EP released soon, it’ll be extremely interesting to see where **Wake! Owl** takes his sound from here, as he clearly posses a valuable songwriting ability. Check out the serotonin rush that is _Wild Country_ below, and head over to the **Wake! Owl** [bandcamp](http://wakeowl.bandcamp.com/) for a free download of the track.",
