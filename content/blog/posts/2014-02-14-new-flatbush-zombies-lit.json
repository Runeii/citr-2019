Well New York rap trio **Flatbush Zombies** have the perfect soundtrack for that romantic stoner session with your loved one.\n\nThrown up online the night before Valentines, the track is FZ through and through. Eric ‘The Architect’ Elliot’s languorous treacle beat production married with some vocal accompaniment from **Yasmin** lays the foundation for the trio to build on with their super-smooth specialist flow of dark, dank, drug induced lyricisms. Happy Valentines.",
