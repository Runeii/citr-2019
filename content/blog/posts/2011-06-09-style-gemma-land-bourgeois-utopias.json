Regardless of the words and claims that precede her, **Land’s** latest work is astonishing in its ability to quietly disturb. The work in question is a line of scarves produced by collective, **[The Creative Archives (TCA).](http://www.thecreativearchives.com)** Taking disused ‘Bourgeois Utopias’ as her field of vision, she manages to make us fear, while ultimately remaining fascinated, by the cultures and history that make up Britain.\n\nThe line is also extremely limited, made out of pure silk and thoroughly ornate despite the rather serious conceptual undertone. Check the link to buy below.\n\n[**Buy a Scarf.**](http://www.luisaviaroma.com/index.aspx#getData.aspx)",
