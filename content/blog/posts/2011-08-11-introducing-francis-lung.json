  "body": "For those of you who tuned in to **Huw Stephen’s** bizarre interview with elusive Manchester based outfit **WU LYF**, you may have heard them select a track by a certain **Francis Lung** to feature on the show.\n\nAgain, in typical **World Unite** tradition, they revealed little else about Brooklyn Girls, however a bit of digging reveals that **Francis Lung** is the pseudonym of **Tom McClung**, the groups bassist.\n\nGone are the rasping, confrontational vocals of **Ellery Roberts**, instead replaced by the mournful tones of **McClung**, equally as emotionally poignant. The sombre organs are displaced by lightly plucked guitars, making for an entirely different listening experience. Of the demos found on **Francis Lung’s** [tumblr](http://francislung.tumblr.com/), the highlights are the thoughtful ballad of _Brooklyn Girls_ and the slightly more upbeat _Keep It Brave_. With these songs, Tom McClung adds a much welcome element of diversity to the **WU LYF** sound, one which will hopefully be developed over the coming months. Check out _Brooklyn Girls_ below.\n\n [WU LYF – Brooklyn Girls](http://soundcloud.com/pmwtumblr/wu-lyf-brooklyn-girls) by [pmwtumblr](http://soundcloud.com/pmwtumblr)",
