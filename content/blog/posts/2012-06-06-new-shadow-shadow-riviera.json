  "body": "Scandinavia has proved a more than fertile breeding ground for synth-pop artists in recent years, and **Shadow Shadow** are no exception to that trend.\n\nAlmost how I’d imagine **The Killers** to sound had they grown up in the Northern European haven, _Riviera_ is everything you could want from an indie pop anthem, fantastic male/female vocals, a ludicrously addictive hook and an overwhelming feeling of euphoria. So we’ll never fall in love, but at least we have now.\n\n<a href=\"http://shadowshadow.bandcamp.com/track/riviera\">Riviera by Shadow Shadow</a>",
