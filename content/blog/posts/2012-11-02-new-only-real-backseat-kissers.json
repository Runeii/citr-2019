  "body": "One of the fastest rising talents in the UK, London youngster **Only Real** is a welcome antidote to all those yearning the ironic socio-political commentary of **Jamie T**.\n\nGritty, raw and admirably true to its roots, _Backseat Kissers_ showcases a more soulful side to the young troubadour, yet with the same drug-induced lethargy found on previous tracks. Still very early days, **Only Real** is fine example of talent rising above PR ploys and marketing gimmicks.",
