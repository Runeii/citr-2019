  "date": "2016-07-01T10:43:32",
  "body": "Continuously blown away by the flawless vocal of London’s **Grace Lightman**.\n\n_White China (Raging Bull)_, the b-side to recent single, Faultless, finds her returning the track to it’s roots a little, keeping the intimate songwriting and her tender voice as the focal points. Lyrically it’s as heart-wrenchingly honest as we’ve come to expect from Lightman – ‘_you know I’m porcelain / white china in your hands / impossible to hold_‘; yet another hugely exciting step forward for the young songwriter.\n\nFollow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
