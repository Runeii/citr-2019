  "body": "Before you think that CitR has taken an untimely and unnecessary turn into reviewing obscene pornographic soundtracks, let me assure you that Raw Moans are a legitimate musical group, and a brilliant one at that.\n\nTheir newest release, Safe Sex is a digital only two track single featuring That’s Us/Wild Combination and Lightning Strikes, both which show very differing sides to the lo-fi inspired group.\n\nIt’s highly electronically based, That’s Us/Wild Combination being primarily synth driven, whilst melodic drones circle hungrily in the background. It’s elegant and vaguely haunting; moans of ‘_I can’t wait another minute to see you_‘ prowl wistfully throughout the track, verging upon delirious in style. Whilst on ‘B-side’ Lightning Strikes, Raw Moans portray a far more upbeat and jovial aspect to the group, without straying from their electronic roots. There’s touches of 80’s disco hidden amongst the influences, fused with their invigorating and diverse lo-fi sound, making Safe Sex a rewarding experience…\n\n<a href=\"http://rawmoans.bandcamp.com/album/safe-sex\">SAFE SEX by RAW MOANS</a>",
