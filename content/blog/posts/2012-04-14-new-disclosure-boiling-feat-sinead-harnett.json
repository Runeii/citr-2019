  "body": "We’ve known for a while now just how talented the **Disclosure** kids are, with them undoubtedly being at the forefront of the hugely exciting movement of young, innovative producers.\n\nNew track _Boiling_ featuring the sumptuous vocals of **Sinead Harnett** may well be their finest work to date, conjuring up a magical and thoroughly enthralling atmosphere amongst the deep synths and dubstep inspired beat. _Boiling_ is the first track to be taken from their highly anticipated forthcoming EP _**The Face**_ released 4 June on [**Greco-Roman**](http://greco-roman.net/).",
