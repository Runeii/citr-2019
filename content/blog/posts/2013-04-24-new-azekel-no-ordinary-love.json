  "body": "**Azekel**, our brother from another mother, dropped a smooth as hell new track this morning, entitled _No Ordinary Love._\n\nThe cut is strikingly reminiscent of some of **Frank Ocean**’s first mixtape, but it’s in no way a disservice to the track. **Azekel**’s lyrics are pungently honest; he states his feelings rather than unnecessarily shrouding them in metaphor, which is frankly becoming a bit of an anomaly within the RnB world at the moment. Expect more soon.",
