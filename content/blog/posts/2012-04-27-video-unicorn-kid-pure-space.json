The phrase ‘too cool for school’ might as well have been written for this video. But do you know what? I don’t care. If kids want to drop E, play Gameboy classics in Berlin subways and spend every given moment looking like they’re posing for a **Dazed and Confused** shoot, then who am I to stop them?\n\nExactly, I’m nobody.\n\nGoing to go cry now.",
