  "body": "This debut track from New York’s **Green Eyes** feels like it should be wafting out of a slightly seedy, underground dive bar in Brooklyn.\n\nA vaguely heartbeat-esque steady drum beat is paired with quite 70’s sounding, bleak guitars, both pitted against the sultry yet stunning vocals of Green Eyes. ‘_Waves will weep, all for me, and for how you’ve done me wrong_‘ bemoans the as yet anonymous singer, drawing from blues and jazz, twisted into a more accesible, emotionally fraught debut track. Coming in at under three minutes, one can’t help but yearn for more music from **Green Eyes**. Check out _Dusk on the 5th_ below.",
