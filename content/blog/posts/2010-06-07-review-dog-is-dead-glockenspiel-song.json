Combining pop, rock and jazz influences, they create perfectly rounded energetic, bouncy tunes, which are easy on the ears as well as being joyfully uplifting. Having received rave reviews from **Drowned In Sound**, as well as **Huw Stephens** declaring himself a fan, **Dog is Dead** are certainly destined for bigger things. Their debut single “_Glockenspiel Song_” is released on itunes today, and is a mesmerising pop spectacular, part **Guillemots**, part **Los Campesinos!**, the song reaches it’s pinnacle with the guys shouting “_we are a mess! we failures! and we love it!_” over the top of a scintillatingly played saxophone. So if you have a spare 79p, there are few better ways you could spend it than on **Dog Is Dead’s** debut single.\n\n[Check Out Their Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/dogisdeadband)\n\n[Buy Glockenspiel Song on iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/glockenspiel-song/id372218236)",
