  "date": "2016-03-06T12:30:51",
  "body": "As the founder of the London Contemporary Voices Choir, it’s fair to say that **Anil Sebastian** has seen his fair share of buzz worthy collaborations, with previous experience working with Alt-J, Basement Jaxx and Imogen Heap.\n\nSo it’s no surprise to hear that his solo debut, _Closer_, is one of epic proportions. Sweeping string sections, ethereal backing vocals, and some truly scintillating production; it wouldn’t be out of place on a Hollywood film soundtrack. Check it out below.",
