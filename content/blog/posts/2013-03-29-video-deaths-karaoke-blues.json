  "body": "This self-directed new video from Czech Republic based synth-pop artist **Deaths** aka Igor Bruso explores friendship in a weirdly dystopian manner.\n\nAlmost like Tarantino directing a music video, it’s foundations lie within realism yet it adopts a knowingly cinematic feel, purposefully intense and forever on the edge. With the help of one half of London duo IYES, it’s a bold track, mainly through its percussion led composition and foreboding vocal sections. Following an armed raid on a hotel in search of a magic stone of immortality, amidst the scenes of havoc and destruction, there’s the occasional glimpse of humanity; be it a single glint of desperation in the eye of one of the raiders or two characters briefly catching each others gaze for a split second. Check out the video below, and keep up with [Deaths](http://www.facebook.com/wethedeaths) on Facebook.\n\n[Deaths – Karaoke Blues](http://vimeo.com/62573655) from [Igor Bruso](http://vimeo.com/igorbruso) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).\n\n[![Crack In The Road](http://www.blogkeen.com/stats.aspx?id=457420&p=1&l=en)](http://www.blogkeen.com/visit_blog.aspx?id=457420&mid=94413&f=true \"Crack In The Road\")",
