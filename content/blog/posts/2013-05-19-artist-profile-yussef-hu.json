  "body": "Situated in a room looking like something out of an episode of Dexter.\n\n**Yuseff Hu,** tired and probably nauseous, staggers round the room full of nervously laughing spectators, preparing for each stage of his performance, **_Resting on a sharp point_**_.  2013_\n\nThe task executed is to spear what looks like massive carcass sacks filled with balloons pumped full of ketchup, mayonnaise, mustard and brown sauce. The oozing condiments leak into a bucket placed below this hoisted pack and the artist, gagging and shaking, ingests this readymade burger sauce before repeating the whole process five times.\n\nI’ve always had a strong stomach, but this tested me. A piece of art that could induce nausea to this degree definitely deserves a mention. I will take my hat off to anyone who could sit through the full 47 minutes.\n\nFor Yussef’s website Click [**HERE**](http://yussefhu.com/Resting-on-a-Sharp-Point).\n\nThe documented performance will be on at the **Slade BA/BFA Degree Show** until the 23rd May.\n\nFor more information Click [**HERE**](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/slade/degree2013/).\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/yuseff-hu.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21980-artist-profile-yussef-hu/attachment/yuseff-hu/)\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/yuseff-hu4.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21980-artist-profile-yussef-hu/attachment/yuseff-hu4/)\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/yuseff-hu5.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21980-artist-profile-yussef-hu/attachment/yuseff-hu5/)\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/yuseffhu6.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21980-artist-profile-yussef-hu/attachment/yuseffhu6/)\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/yuseffhu8.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21980-artist-profile-yussef-hu/attachment/yuseffhu8/)",
