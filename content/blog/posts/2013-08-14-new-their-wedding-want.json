  "body": "**Their Wedding** from LA set the bar for bitter band names, and their debut track, _Want_ only further heightens the sense of lustful jealously that dominates their music.\n\nWith [Panama Wedding](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/23221-new-panama-wedding-all-of-the-people/) and [East of Ely](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/23555-new-east-of-ely-easy-friend/) releasing two of the finest indie-pop gems heard in recent times, **Their Wedding** wander a similar path, with their expertly written, silk sounding first outing. With the repeated refrain ‘_She reminds me of you / and it’s hard ‘cus I want it so bad_‘ dominating much of the track, it’s likely to shoot up the Hype Machine, and quite rightly so. Check out _Want_ below.",
