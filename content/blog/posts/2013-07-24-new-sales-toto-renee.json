  "body": "Having impressed with their playful debut track _renee_, Orlando duo **sales** have released a follow up track, in the form of the adorably dreamy _toto_.\n\nAs with their first outing, toto relies on the simplistic instrumentation and stunning vocals provided by Lauren Morgan. There’s touches of Beach House and Fiest, yet all tied up with their own unique brand of twee lo-fi. Check out _toto_ and _renee_ below, and keep up with the duo via [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Wearenotsales).",
