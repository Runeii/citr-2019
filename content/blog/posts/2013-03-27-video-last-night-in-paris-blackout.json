  "body": "httpv://www.\n\nyoutube.com/watch?v=mCZidRAtNbI\n\nLondon based art/fashion/music collective Last Night In Paris have put out a video for their track ‘Blackout’. The song finds the group in scintillating form, with members Taurean Roye, Flowzart, Sir. Berus and Collard all spitting with confidence and style. The beat consists of rolling bass underneath squelchy single-note synth stabs with the drums on a half-beat.\n\n‘Blackout’ also has a pretty impressive video. It does nothing particularly special in its portrayal of night life, but it is constructed, edited and shot with the utmost skill. The cuts and camera movement create an aesthetic spectacle that reflects both the lyrical content and general feel of the song. If you like ‘Blackout’ then check out _Roses_, the group’s mixtape, which is available for download [here](https://soundcloud.com/lastnightinparis/sets/roses).",
