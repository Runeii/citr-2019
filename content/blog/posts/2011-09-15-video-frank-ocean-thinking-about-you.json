  "body": "It’s been a good few months since **[Frank Ocean](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/9447-new-frank-ocean-thinking-about-you/ \"New: Frank Ocean – Thinking About You\")** dropped his **_[‘Nostalgia, Ultra’](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/4868-review-frank-ocean-nostalgia-ultra/ \"Review: Frank Ocean – Nostalgia, Ultra\")_** Mixtape. In the time that’s gone by the Rn’B game has changed drastically; **[The Weeknd](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/10287-new-the-weeknd-thursday/ \"New: The Weeknd – Thursday\")**, [How to Dress Well](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/8545-new-how-to-dress-well-just-once-ep/ \"New: How To Dress Well – Just Once EP\") and **The Dream**, (to name a few), have continued to expand the genre is ways few could have anticipated.\n\nFor a while many assumed that **Ocean**’s next release would release with a similar business model, however after his recent inclusion in the **_[Watch the Throne](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/9697-review-jay-z-kanye-west-watch-the-throne/ \"Review: Jay Z & Kanye West – Watch The Throne\")_** LP, a free Mixtape seems more and more unlikely. Regardless, **Ocean** continues to commit to his early material. This video for ‘**_Thinking about you_**’, an early demo for **Bridget Kelly**, is only the newest example of this.\n\nMade by **High5Collective**, this bizarre surrealist story takes the essence of the track and runs with it in the most bathetic and poignant of ways. It even includes a cameo from **Ocean** himself.\n\nStream the video below.\n\n[Frank Ocean – Thinking About You (music video)](http://vimeo.com/28366669) from [High5Collective](http://vimeo.com/h5c) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
