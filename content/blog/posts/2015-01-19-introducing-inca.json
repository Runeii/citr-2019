  "body": "Half Peruvian and half English is about as much information as we’re given when it comes to INCA, along with a misty, ambiguous image that echoes the spacious, enigmatic nature of her debut track ‘Wake Me Up’.\n\nBased upon a pulsating, bass heavy beat bedrock, INCA’s striking vocals soar over the minimalist production as she appeals directly to the listener, forming a somewhat ethereal, repeating plea of ‘I need somebody like you’.\n\nDefinitely a one to watch in 2015, check out INCA’s debut effort below.",
