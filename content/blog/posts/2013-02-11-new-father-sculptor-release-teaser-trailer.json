Featuring a soundtrack which stands as the band’s newest material since their well received collection of summer demos, the trailer employs a great level of visual ambiguity and a development upon what was already a very strong aesthetic presence. Concluding with the flashing statement, ‘Faith & Violence’, one can only guess as to what else is set to be released from Father Sculptor in the coming weeks, however they have recently confirmed support dates with **Wolf Alice **& **Swim Deep**.",
