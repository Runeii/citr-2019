This being our first in house production of an unplugged session, we were honoured that the band agreed to shoot two videos of ‘**River Jordan**‘ and ‘**Hands Down**‘.\n\nAfter following the band since our first interview with them at last year’s **Dot To Dot Festival**, **Crack In The Road** have remained stalwart fans of **Dog Is Dead** and we’re over the moon to see the band gaining an ever increasing level of attention and praise from critics and fans alike!\n\nA last minute change in shooting venue meant that the lighting was a slight problem, however we all feel that this takes very little away from the fantastic musical talent and atmosphere present in the video. I’ve edited ‘River Jordan’ and ‘Hands Down’ to be black and white, however there are normal copies on my Vimeo account should you prefer the wonders of technicolour! I’ll end my spiel here, however thanks again are due to the fantastic **Dog Is Dead**, and I hope this marks the beginning of many more **Crack In The Road Unplugged Sessions**. Enjoy!\n\n[Dog Is Dead – River Jordan](http://vimeo.com/20850957) from [Ben Blackburn](http://vimeo.com/user6202763) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).\n\n[Dog Is Dead – Hands Down](http://vimeo.com/20640204) from [Ben Blackburn](http://vimeo.com/user6202763) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
