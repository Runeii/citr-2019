  "body": "So the whole ‘elusive, mysterious’ act is beginning to wear dangerous thin, leaving the likes of Manchester’s **NO CEREMONY** with an interesting decision to make.\n\nDo they ditch the entire concept completely, or plough through in the hope that the quality of the music will detract from any misgivings others may have about whether or not the illusion is genuine creativity or a mere marketing ploy? Either way, as long as they keep producing tracks to the quality of new cut _Holdonme_, they’re bound to keep people interested. A lively synth heavy number, there’s touches of 80’s electro-pop despite it’s more sinister undertones.",
