  "body": "Not known is much about **Mom Tudie**, other than he’s a 17 year old producer based in south east London, and he’s called Tom.\n\nSince the rise of **J£ZUS MILLION,** **Disclosure,** and **Happa**, it’s now slightly easier to digest that producers tend to be incredulously young and talented, and **Mom Tudie** will no doubt join that list.\n\nWith a few tracks on his soundcloud, which you can check out [here](https://soundcloud.com/momtudie), it is Tudie’s latest effort that stands out the most; a re-work of **Nicola Thoms** ‘Make Up Your Mind’. With influences ranging from hip-hop to garage, and an underlying sense of chillstep, this track has certainly made me excited for what Mom Tudie comes out with next.\n\nThanks to our friends at **Music Broke My Bones** for the tip!
