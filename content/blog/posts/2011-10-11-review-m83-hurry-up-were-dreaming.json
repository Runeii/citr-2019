  "body": "My first live experience of French electro-pop outfit **M83** was at **T in the Park** several years back.\n\nSandwiched between the then fresh faced **Vampire Weekend** and **MGMT** in the King Tuts Tent, their set was almost entirely instrumental. As you can imagine, this didn’t go down well with those who had merely stumbled into the tent to shout ‘_hey hey hey hey_‘ and bellow drunkenly during the chorus in _Kids_; which unfortunately was the vast majority of the crowd. However it was a hugely engaging performance, with the group conjuring up luscious shoegaze inspired soundscapes, adding a pivotal moment of clarity between the overhyped chaotic acts either side of them on the bill.\n\nSeveral years on, and **M83** are yet to unearth the sort of success that the aforementioned groups have found, solely down to the fact that they haven’t written a ‘hit’. Their fifth album from 2008, **_Saturdays = Youth_** was an accomplished record in it’s own right, but didn’t contain the sort of out-and-out anthems that would propel it onto day time radio. Always championed as a sensational live act, their sixth album, _**Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming**_ aims to capture the energy of their performances and channel it into a full length release.\n\nIf there’s something **_Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming_** cannot be accused of, it’s lacking anthems. Lead single _Midnight City_ contains one of the most frustratingly infectious choruses since **MGMT** molested our ears; a festival favourite in waiting that is destined to be chanted inanely whilst slurping on a can of strongbow’s finest. Obvious and immediate comparisons can be drawn to **U2**, in the formulaic songwriting procedure, a trait that isn’t especially endearing and makes for a rather impersonal listen. With the opening track, ingeniously titled _Intro_, featuring goth pop songstress **Zola Jesus**, it’s a sure fire signal of intent; **M83** want these tracks to be heard, by everyone.\n\nThe list of stadium fillers goes on, with _Reunion_ following an unsurprisingly similar method to _Midnight City_. It’s not offensive as such, or either unlistenable, just rather predictable and without any real character. If **_Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming_** was comprised of nine or ten tracks of ball-busting anthems, then that would be perfectly acceptable, albeit probably not to my taste. However coming in at over eighty minutes, it’s a fairly hefty listen and begins to feel cumbersome around the half way point.\n\nWhilst it may not work especially well as a collection of tracks, there are some hidden gems, such as the slow burning, remorseful _Wait_ and album highlight _Raconte-Moi Une Histoire._ Sampling a young girl telling a charmingly innocent story, it’s tracks like _Raconte-Moi._… where **M83** excel, not written as a singalong yet strangely entrancing. By the time the record rolls into _New Map_, it would take a very patient listener to still be alert, despite there still being almost half the album remaining. The epic _Steve McQueen_ is one of the few examples of the stadium born anthems that really works and makes for pleasant listening.\n\nTwenty two tracks is simply too many for an album written in such an outwardly pop orientated style; a shame because there are some interesting moments within the release. _**Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming**_ is an ambitious step up from the **T in the Park** performance all those years back, and I suspect an album like this would have been far more accommodating to the crowd on that day. Containing more hooks than a casting call for a theatre production of Peter Pan, _**Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming**_ will fascinate some, and severely disappoint others; with **M83** undoubtedly forming a staple part of next years festival season.\n\nHead over to the [Urban Outfitters](http://www.urbanoutfitters.co.uk/page/m83) site to stream the album in full.",
