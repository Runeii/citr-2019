  "body": "A band called **Lisbon**, with a song called _Rio_… confusing, huh? Anyway, Whitley Bay quartet Lisbon have already captured the hearts of the North East and have spent the summer winning over more fans on the festival circuit.\n\nWith their debut single, Bluelove, putting them on the radars of tipsters around the UK, their second offering, Rio, is another delicious slice of riotous indie-pop. With a handful of sold-out Newcastle shows already under their belts, and a London show on Wednesday night (Sebright Arms), it’s only a matter of time before they start making a serious impact in the capital. Check out Rio below.",
