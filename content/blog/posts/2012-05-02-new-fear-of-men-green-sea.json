  "body": "London/Brighton’s **[Fear of Men](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/12375-new-fear-of-men-doldrums/ \"New: Fear Of Men – Doldrums\")** have been getting me hot under the collar for a little while now. Not least because they’re all beautiful young things, but perhaps more maturely//professionally, they make blissful summery jams that suddenly have the right season for a backdrop.\n\nTheir new single, **_Green Sea_**, sees them adopt a more expansive, more contemplative sound. “_Some days I need way more than I’ve got_”, admits Jess in the song’s early bars. It’s blunt, honest and in some ways simple song writing, but it’s all they need.\n\nThe **_Green Sea_** 7″ single is limited to 300 copies on white vinyl and is [due out on June 18 via SexBeat.](http://sexbeat.bigcartel.com/product/sexbeat-013-fear-of-men-green-sea-pre-order)",
