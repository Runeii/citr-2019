  "body": "It’s about time we heard more of **Berninger’s** sultry tones, and this new **Silver Alert** remix of **Grinderman’s** _Evil_ just so happens to feature the vocal talents of **The National** frontman.\n\nSet to be included on an upcoming remix release entitled _**Grinderman 2 RMX**_, alongside efforts from **Robert Fripp**, **Josh Homme** and **Cat’s Eyes**. It’s a slightly bizarre affair, twisting rapidly between pitch shifted vocals and the recognizable drawl of **Berninger**, whilst remaining thoroughly engaging throughout. Check it out below, and watch out for the _**Grinderman 2 RMX**_ which drops 26 March 2012.",
