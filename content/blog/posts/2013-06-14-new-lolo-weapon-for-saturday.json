  "body": "Working with Mark Batson (Dre / Eminem) on your debut single is quite an achievement, and dare I say, a rather daunting prospect.\n\nHowever if there’s one element to be taken from **Lolo’s** debut single proper, _Weapon For Saturday_, it’s that her confident, slightly brash swagger leaves a lasting impression. Again, I’m hesitant to draw the comparison, but there’s aspects of the ‘don’t take no shit’ vibe given off by the likes of Lana Del Rey, Fergie and even P!nk (shout out to the latter, first ever CitR mention), yet with a rougher, more true to roots hip-hop vibe. All things considered, it’s a mightily bold and extravagant first outing, sure to turn numerous heads.",
