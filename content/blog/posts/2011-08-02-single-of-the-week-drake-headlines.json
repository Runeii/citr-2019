  "body": "You get a lot of things from **Drake**, but above all else you get honesty.\n\nThe first single to drop from his imminent LP, _Take Care_, is an instant and frank spew of naïve feelings. He almost seems oblivious to the world he has such a tight grip of, “I might be too strung out on compliments, overdosed on confidence”, **Drake** unashamedly admits in the tune’s first bar. This is the work of a man that puts the message, and indeed his utterly biased personal message, above all else.\n\nStream and download the single below.\n\n [Drake – Headlines](http://soundcloud.com/hypetrak/drake-headlines) by [Hypetrak](http://soundcloud.com/hypetrak)",
