  "title": "New: Jeremiah Jae – Fame (Prod. By Ras G)",
  "date": "2013-01-09T13:45:34",
  "body": "After **[Jeremiah Jae](https://soundcloud.com/jeremiahjae)** announced that he would be releasing a track a day for the next 10 days, this just 5 days ago, I concluded that bringing you guys new music would be pretty easy, at least for the next 10 days. In reality I forgot about the whole damn thing. On a brighter note, the series of tracks has sucked me once again, in the form of this mist laden, spaced as hell jam in collaboration with [Ras G](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ras-G/87270041141), a producer who receives nowhere near as much attention as he deserves.\n\nWith a few more tracks on the horizon from this _Black Jungle Radio_ series, head over to **Jae**’s [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/jeremiahjae/) to soak them up.",
