Blu)\") we reported on a new cut from the emphatically strange and mysterious, **[Gonjasufi](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/216-gonjasufi-a-sufi-and-a-killer/ \"Review: Gonjasufi – A Sufi And A Killer\")**, and the free EP it was taken from. Well, as reported, the EP has dropped. 4 tracks of new material; not exactly the wealth of music I was hoping from a man that’s been away for so long. Regardless the EP is focused, remarkably more hip-hop based and as dark, weird and warped as ever.\n\nStream and download the EP **[here.](http://www.hydroshare.tv/index.php?/Gonjasufi-The9thInningEP.html)**\n\n![](http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.11NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMTk3MzM*OTQ2MDYmcHQ9MTMxOTczMzQ5NzM1MyZwPSZkPSZnPTImbz**MDRlYTIwNDBmZTA*M2E4OGI4M2QxYjYw/OTg2YjE4OSZvZj*w.gif)[video platform](http://corp.kaltura.com)[video management](http://corp.kaltura.com/video_platform/video_management)[video solutions](http://corp.kaltura.com/solutions/video_solution)[video player](http://corp.kaltura.com/video_platform/video_publishing)",
