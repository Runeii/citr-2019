  "date": "2017-05-18T18:44:06",
  "body": "Etyen’s new track _Homosapiens _is a super sweet bit of electro pop that you will have on repeat.\n\nFrom start to finish the track has an incredibly infectious energy. Built off a production style that is very in your face with the amount going on the intricacies of the track initially aren’t obvious. However the song progresses in such a way that everything from the structure of the beat to the way that the synths work with Tala’s vocals is revealed in a really satisfying way. In the case of Tala’s verses they add such an ethereal tone to the track that shines thanks to twinkling synth riff and heavenly chord progression that beautifully support her. Homosapiens is a stunning single that fans of Visions era Grimes will get a most welcome nostalgia trip off.",
