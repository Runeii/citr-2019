  "date": "2013-01-24T00:24:06",
  "body": "For an artist that’s been chilling in my ear for quite a while now, **LE1F** has been a bit of a no show when it comes to gracing our pages.\n\nHis new cut, _Coins_, puts an end to that. Taken from his follow up to _DARK YORK_, entitled _Fly Zone,_ _the track builds on the sound that brought LE1F to all our attentions. Coins_ has a remarkable new level of clarity, with **LE1F**’s vocals spared of the reverb that in my opinion was laid on far too freely in the last mixtape. His flow has also improved, with the track coming across as some sort of performance rather than simply a track. If the whole mixtape is as forward, intentionally trashy and performance focused as this, we could have something special on our hands.\n\n_Fly Zone_ _drops next Monday via_ Greedhead and Camp & Street.",
