  "body": "Now over a year since we’ve heard any original material from **Tei Shi**, and it’s clear she’s been making the most of the past twelve months.\n\nNot only announcing live dates for CMJ where she’ll be playing the Crack in the Road x Disco Naïveté official showcase (more info in the coming days), she’s also released exquisite new track, _Bassically_. Easily her most confident vocal outing to date, it’s bold, assertive and all-in-all, a simply fantastic pop track; one of the best of the year. Check it out below.",
