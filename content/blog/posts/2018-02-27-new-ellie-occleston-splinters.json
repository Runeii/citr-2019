  "body": "This gorgeous debut single from eighteen year old **Ellie Occleston** is well worth a listen.\n\nSpine tinglingly honest, and containing one of the finest chorus hooks I’ve heard for quite some time, it truly flourishes in its sparseness, whilst certainly feeling like it could be revisited with more expansive instrumentation to it at some point. In part, it reminds me of the early Tobias Jesso Jr demos that found their way to Youtube, in that the possibilities feel endless from this position – a sublime first offering. Check out Splinters below.",
