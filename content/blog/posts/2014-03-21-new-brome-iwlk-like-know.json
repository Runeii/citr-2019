  "body": "Hailing from Quebec and with no other information at the time about who he/she is, **Brome’s **debut track **IWLK (I Would Like To Know)** serves up a fine cut of electrified R&B infused silent thunder.\n\nLoosely based on a sample from **Lucy Rose’**s song **Place**, the young producer builds brick by brick a strictly sentimental wall of sound covered with a bouncy and polished production that could easily bend the hardest of hearts. **IWLK** is promising only the best and hopefully **Brome** will deliver some more shivering tunes like this in the near future.\n\n**IWLK (I Would Like To Know)** is available for free download on **Brome**‘s [bandcamp page](http://bromemusic.bandcamp.com/track/iwlk).  \n\\[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/137361483″ params=”auto\\_play=false&hide\\_related=false&visual=true” width=”100%” height=”450″ iframe=”true” /\\]",
