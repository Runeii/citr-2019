  "body": "The 80’s revival, largely spearheaded by The 1975, feels like it’s beginning to reach it’s peak.\n\nWhat with the likes of Fickle Friends, Shura and Sundara Karma all seeming to draw from the likes of Genesis and Peter Gabriel, it’s very much the in-sound right now. London quartet **FOURS** look set to follow in their footsteps with their gloriously addictive latest track, _Sickly Sweet_. All centred around a hook that wouldn’t be out of place on I Like It When You Sleep…, it’s a bold step forward from the Shepard’s Bush outfit. Check it out below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
