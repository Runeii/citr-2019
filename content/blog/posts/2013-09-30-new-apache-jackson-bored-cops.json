  "title": "New: Apache Jackson – BORED COPS",
  "date": "2013-09-30T21:16:08",
  "body": "Dark, broken and brooding RnB act **Apache Jackson** is back with his first piece of material in over 2 years.\n\nThe Portland native was one of our ‘sounds of 2012’, perhaps back then we had jumped the gun a bit, with only 2 EPs under his belt he still had a significant amount to prove. _BORED COPS_, see’s him take a refreshing new direction. The synths and bass are thicker; the vocals powerful, taking reference from **Gabriel Bruce**, and the overall pop aesthetic takes centre stage. Interested to see where this project goes again.",
