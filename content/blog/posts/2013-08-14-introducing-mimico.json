  "body": "There’s not a great deal out there on canadian pysch-kids Jeremiah Knight (Guitar), Ben Oginz (Synth) and Nick Kervin (Percussion & Bass) AKA **MIMICO.**\n\nHailing from Toronto, they seem to have appeared online sometime in late 2011 and laid relatively low up to now, releasing their first EP on Bandcamp back in May.\n\nStarting as a duo creating _‘long-form experimental pieces’  _using a guitar and synth, adding a third member to tighten their arrangements has resulted in a sound that winds across the duration of the EP. One minute squealing guitars and driving beats that _need _to become the intro to a 80s cop-drama remake, the next spacey tones and oscillating drones and moaning vocals.  \n\nFind their EP below (if you can’t fit in the whole thing, pick _Astroblade__)_.\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”http://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/7164889″ params=”auto\\_play=false&show\\_artwork=true&color=ff7700″ width=”100%” height=”450″ iframe=”true” /\\]",
