  "body": "It was only a few hours ago I was leaving the office listening to **[Cities Aviv’s](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/12335-new-cities-aviv-wet-dream/ \"New: Cities Aviv – Wet Dream\")** debut Mixtape, ‘**_Digital Lows_**’. When I got home his new track, ‘**_Flex your gold_**’, was sitting in my inbox. That’s what you get for rinsing records. The follow up to his self-released single, ‘**_Wet Dream_**’, is a remarkably lo-fi endeavor. Reverberating moans and rattling beats form the bulk of the sonic sphere, with **Aviv**’s vocals near but consumed in the arrangement. It’s by no means a large leap forward compared to the efforts of **Aviv**’s past, yet it’s a welcome experiment nonetheless.\n\nStream the track below.",
