  "body": "Tomorrow **[Mykki Blanco](http://soundcloud.com/mykkiblanco)** finally releases his debut Mixtape, _Cosmic Angel: The Illuminati Prince/ss_, and should if the world has any sense, symbolise the start of a new movement. **Blanco** has been gaining more and more hype over the past few months, and rightly so, his music has a transgressive quality that rejects boundaries on its own terms, rather than simply jumping through the fractures and blemishes formed by his contemporaries like **Death Grips** and **Le1f**. What **Blanco** does is different, his character is brash, bitchy and aggressive just like the fore mentioned artists but the difference is simple. Those artists want to change the world, **Blanco** wants to own it.",
