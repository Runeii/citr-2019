  "body": "Here’s a lovely winter’s afternoon jam from Newbridge’s **[Peadar Kearney](http://www.thepointofeverything.com/2012/10/03/peadar-kearney-ahab/)**. It’s daringly simple, with **Kearney** working with simple beat loops and melodies and little else. Yet it’s the straight edge atmosphere and narrative that’s the track’s main strength. It doesn’t want to surprise you, making its intentions clear from the outset, however with such fleeting and glistening melodies, simplicity doesn’t seam to matter.\n\nHead over to **Peadar Kearney**’s [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/peadar-kearney) for more.",
