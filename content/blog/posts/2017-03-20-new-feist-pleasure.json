  "body": "Pleasureis the long awaited return from Feist in the wake of her 5th album.\n\n6 years is a long time for an artist to take off; concerns of a stale or dated sounding comeback would be fair. However, Pleasure doesn’t leave fans worrying for long showing the benefits of a fresher grittier sound. A palm muted guitar intro starts the track gently with Feist taking vocal cues from contemporaries Karen O and P J Harvey as she works within the space of a more skeletal sound. The tracks development is euphoric after a gnarled solo guitar bridge with the 2nd verse building up instrumentally leading into one of the most feel good choral endings to a song you’ll have heard this year. Feist hopefully won’t wait too long to release what is now an even more hotly anticipated album.",
