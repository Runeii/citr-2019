  "body": "When **_[‘Peso’](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob3ktDxAjWI)_** dropped, the blog world went fucking nuts. And rightly so, the track took penis-parading rap, kept what was interesting, left the rest and injected the culture with something altogether unhinged. **ASAP Rocky** latest free release is a different beast entirely, **_“patience is a virtue, life is a handful, friends they will hurt you, I learnt that from my grandfolks”_**, it does a great job at expressing the projectile vomit that is a young man’s pursuit for some sort of sense. Even if it’s pseudo-philosophical, it’s redeeming and charming.\n\nYet on the flip side, there’s the darker more materialistic side of the track that seems to be the result of such philosophies. **_“Money over bitches”_** exclaims Rocky, which of course in a sense could negate any attempt at understanding, yet in fact it does the opposite. The way Rocky raps is so convincing, witty and assured that watching this flawed human being becomes a beacon of hope.\n\nStream the track below.",
