This song will no doubt be a massive hit at festivals this summer- they are playing on the Red Bull Stage- and will no doubt be one of the highlights of any festival-goers weekend.\n\nThe lyrics themselves are beautifully crafted to show further why this song will become one of this summer’s biggest successes, with such a upbeat chorus ‘you’re a layer of my clothes made of ivy and gold’. The delicate guitars and drums compliment the lyrics massively, allowing the melody to take hold of the listener. After listening to _Ivy & Gold_, I believe the album, _Flaws_, will become an equally massive success especially after their festival appearances at T in the Park, Oxygen and Glastonbury festivals.\n\n[Watch an acoustic performance of Ivy & Gold here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK2fWmsBUzk)\n\n[Check out their Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/bombaybicycleclub)",
