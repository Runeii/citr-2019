  "body": "Australia’s **Wyatt** seemingly fell off the radar following the release of his debut self-titled EP back in 2014.\n\nAppearing seemingly out of nowhere (having previously been known more for his managerial work than his own music), the EP showcased some endearingly tender songwriting, alongside slick, refined production skills, yet turned out to be the last we’d hear from Wyatt for the best part of two years. His welcome return, _Silhouette_, is a bold step up, production wise there’s elements of Sampha and Jai Paul, whilst the songwriting is more James Blake or How To Dress Well – fragile yet resilient. Check it out below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
