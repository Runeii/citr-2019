  "body": "I’ve been on somewhat of a grungey guitar binge at the moment, what with the mellow-toned **Wavering Hands** and the scuzzy ‘take no prisoners’ **Candy Paint** both unleashing ferocious debut tracks over the past couple of days, step up to the plate Darlings, Brooklyn’s latest uber -cool quartet.\n\nGritty choruses and a slightly lethargic attitude, it’s not clear as to whether they’re about to explode into life mid-song, or collapse into a heap on the floor. Take the 60’s swing of _Nothing I Don’t Care For_, a track so wonderfully careless that you hardly notice when it slips effortlessly into the **Wild Nothing**\\-esque drawl of **Pet The Ghost**. Now don’t get me wrong, I love **Darlings**, and for all their energy, it’s quite something that they manage to sound so gloriously and enjoyably apathetic.",
