  "title": "New: Ouisa Hound – Memorand / Our Wake",
  "date": "2012-03-05T18:24:09",
  "body": "After releasing his debut LP _**[The Joy Eclectic](http://ouisahound.bandcamp.com/album/the-joy-eclectic)**_, earlier this year (review coming soon I promise!), **Ouisa Hound** is back with two new cuts in the form of _Memorand_ and _Our Wake_. Two tracks that may feature on his sophomore effort (titled _**Enclosures**_), they’re dark, brooding and wonderfully poetic, with _Memorand_ twisting and turning like a rabid animal trapped amongst squalid confinements.\n\nOn the flip side, _Our Wake_ is a post-rock inspired affair, again showcasing **Ouisa Hounds**‘ entirely unique ability to conjure up an atmosphere that is both menacing and veraciously beautiful. Check out _Memorand_ above and _Our Wake_ below.",
