  "date": "2014-02-09T20:54:13",
  "body": "Liverpool singer/songwriter/producer** Låpsley** is arguably the most exciting new artist in the UK right now.\n\nWith a couple of her tracks now certified ‘blog hits’, 2014 is shaping up rather nicely, and there’s no doubting that every major label will be keeping an eye on her. New track, _Painter (valentine)_ strips things back to the core of her music; her elegant, considered production and her confident vocals. Play it once and you’ll play it five times.",
