  "body": "_Monomania_, the latest Deerhunter album, is streaming over at NPR.\n\nThe follow-up to 2010’s _Halycon Digest_ finds the group in a more confrontational mood, with the whole thing feeling looser and slightly less melodically inclined than their past few releases. Still, it’s a new Deerhunter album, which is always an exciting prospect and it’ll be interesting to see how _Monomania_, which, for all those who are curious, means a “pathological obsession with one idea or subject”, will hold up after a couple of listens.\n\nThe album is released on the 6th May by the lovely folks over at 4AD. You can hear _Monomania_ via NPR First Listen [here](http://www.npr.org/2013/04/21/177759938/first-listen-deerhunter-monomania). Enjoy yourself kids!",
