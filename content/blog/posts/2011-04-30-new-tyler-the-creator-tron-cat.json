With six million plus views on his recent single Yonkers, and a host of sold out shows across much of the world with the rest of the Odd Future crew; 2011 is going to be a stellar year for OFWGKTA, there is no doubting that.\n\nTron Cat is a brand new cut from GOBLIN, set for release worldwide in just over a week, and continues in a familiar angst driven vein that we’ve become used to from Tyler. After releasing a teaser version of this track several months back, the full version of the track has finally been made available for your listening pleasure. It’s not going to smash the charts, purely for it’s controversial lyrical content, ‘rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends I had a threesome’, being a particular obscene highlight. Listen to Tron Cat below.",
