  "body": "Having already drawn comparisons to the likes of Sonic Youth and The Jesus and Mary Chain, London’s INHEAVEN have made a very strong impact in a very short space of time.\n\nEmerging with the undeniably anthemic  ‘Regeneration’, the band had unleashed a call-to-arms to their peers and a wider youth culture, imploring the importance of the now as an answer to a pervading sense of angst. While ‘Regeneration’ may have been a raucous cry to the world, the band’s sophomore track ‘Slow’ presents itself as a muddier, darker affair, as it is sunk in off kilter guitar riffs and warbling vocals. In presenting ‘Slow’ INHEAVEN demonstrated a more intimate, vulnerable dimension to themselves and their sound, and combined with ‘Regeneration’ it only makes us that much eager to hear their next release.\n\nFollow our [Spotify On Repeat playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a selection of the current hottest tracks.",
