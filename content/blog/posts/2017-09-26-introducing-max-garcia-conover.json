  "body": "“I think I could love somebody now”\n\nTiming can be everything when it comes to hearing music.\n\nThis new album from Maine’s **Max Garcia Conover** proved to be one of those moments for me – in particular the LP’s two central tracks, _Same Deer_ and _Fire on I295_. Songwriting wise there’s elements of the likes of Conor Oberst and Sun Kil Moon in the raw honesty of Conover’s storytelling. These are songs with real heart and character, that demand repeated listens. Check out Same Deer and Fire on I295 below.",
