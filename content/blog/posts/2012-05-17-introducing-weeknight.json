  "body": "Comprised of New York based duo known simply as Holly and Andy, **Weeknight** create the sort of languid, obfuscous pop that swirls slightly menacingly through your eardrums.\n\nThe interlocking male-female vocals contain both beauty and enigmatic characteristics, whether it be the bass heavy _Devil_ or the glitchy _Dark Light (Warrior)_, the crackling guitar lines and other-worldly lyrics elevate Weeknight above many of their synth-led contemporaries. Whilst it’s clearly lacking big budget production, the **Depeche Mode** vibes are prominent throughout, as are the loosely scattered shoegaze percussion sections. All in all, this debut EP entitled _**Dark Dark Lights**_ is an extremely accomplished trio of tracks; I just wish they were called Weaknight instead…\n\n<a href=\"http://weeknightmusic.bandcamp.com/album/dark-dark-lights\">Dark Dark Lights by Weeknight</a>",
