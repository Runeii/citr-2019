  "body": "**Crystal Castles**, a band that divide genres and split fan bases.\n\nTheir debut album was a huge disappointment for me, underwhelming and lacking the mystery that surrounds their epic live shows, however their most recent record, merely titled _II_, is a much welcome grandeur progression. So it was no surprise that their dark, all encompassing sound caught the ear of **The Cure** frontman **Robert Smith**, at which point he expressed his desire to perform on a remix of the duo’s upcoming single _Not In Love_. After recording the track with the legendary singer, it was decided that it was far too special to merely be wasted as a B-side, but would instead be the A-side to the release.\n\nSo here it is, this catchy, anthemic song harks back to _Disintegration_ era **Cure**, with Smith’s vocals adding a much welcome dimension to the **Platinum Blonde** cover. Landing somewhere between a haunted house ride soundtrack, and an 80’s dance hit, _Not In Love_, out on December 6th is one of my favourite tracks of the year.\n\n [Crystal Castles – Not In Love (ft.
