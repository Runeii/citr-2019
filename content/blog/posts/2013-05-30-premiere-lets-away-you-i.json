  "title": "Premiere: Let's Away – You & I",
  "date": "2013-05-30T15:30:49",
  "body": "Alongside **Arbeia**, Sunderland’s [**Let’s Away**](https://www.facebook.com/letsaway) are another of the brightest sparks in what is a brightly burning North East music scene, slowly but surely honing their sound and pulling together their live shows. Playing to the frailties and imperfections of the human mind, new track _You & I_ is a Scott Walker inspired, majestic ballad, and a clear development of their songwriting abilities; languid but deeply affecting. One can just as easily imagine it being played for the first dance of a wedding, as during a funeral march in an uber-cool indie flick.\n\n_You & I_ is taken from a double A single with the equally fantastic _Suitably Loose_, out 17 June, available for purchase via [Bandcamp](letsaway.bandcamp.com). Check out both tracks below.",
