  "date": "2011-10-22T00:50:08",
  "body": "This new track from New York based film student and singer/songwriter **Anna River** is truly heart-breaking.\n\nThere’s a hint of **Feist** in her delicate yet measured vocals, which are layered to fantastic effect throughout _My Only Source For Love_. Where some would settle for a simple acoustic number, **Anna River** has clearly crafted this track to her own specifications, demonstrated through the addition of a percussion section midway through. **Anna** weeps _‘You’re my only source for love, you’re the only reason why I’m crying’_ in a tone so utterly devastating that it’s impossible to not be moved.\n\nCheck out _My Only Source For Love_ below, and head over to **Anna’s** [blog](http://www.itrulylikethat.blogspot.com/) for some insightful ramblings and a scrapbook-esque collection of photos.\n\n<a href=\"http://annariver.bandcamp.com/track/my-only-source-for-love\">My Only Source For Love by Anna River</a>",
