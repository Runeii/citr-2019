  "body": "**The 1975** show that they aren’t adverse to a bit of satire in new video for forthcoming single _Girls_.\n\nOpening with lead singer Matt Healy proclaiming, ‘everything feels totally wrong… we’re not a pop band…it needs to be black and white for a start’, the video is a rare foray into colour visuals. Easily their most Genesis sounding number, the video goes on to mock videos from contemporary ‘popstars’, featuring a scantily-clad female version of the band. Check out the video below, and pick up a copy of their number one album.",
