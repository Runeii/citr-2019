  "body": "Weirdly atmospheric and unimaginably trippy, **Evian Christ’s** new track _FYTS_ almost feels like a homage to 90’s techno, yet without the god-awful synth sections.\n\nKicking in at round about 1.45, it’s a signal of intent from **Evian Christ**, refreshing and thoroughly enthralling and rightfully placing himself above numerous other producers around at the moment. Check out _FYTS_ below, and grab a free download if it’s your thing.",
