Music, and indeed anticipation for music, would never be the same again. Throughout those bittersweet 11 months, there was even talk that **[Jai Paul](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Jai-Paul/205258999506990)** had quit music all together. Not so, his new cut, **_Jasmine_**, finally puts that rumour to bed. It’s late, I’m ill and I’m going to bed, so I won’t bore you with my thoughts on the track.\n\nLet’s just say it’s the best thing I’ve heard all year. Welcome back Mr. Paul.",
