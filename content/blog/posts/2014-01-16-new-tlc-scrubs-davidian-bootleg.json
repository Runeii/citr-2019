  "body": "House music has been taken over and swallowed whole by the increasingly annoying sounds of EDM.\n\nBut to think that house is down for the count would be a HUGE mistake. I already raved about producer Davidian in a previous post, but the boy just keeps delivering the goods. Davidian’s bootleg of TLC’s famous track No Scrub is a solid example of this producers growth and signature sounds. It’s a fresher and new perspective on house. Someone get this kid a residency…preferably in New York City.\n\nHey also free download. MMMMMM free….\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/129800720″ params=”color=ff6600&auto\\_play=false&show\\_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]",
