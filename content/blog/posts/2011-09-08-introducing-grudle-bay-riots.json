And now I find myself sniffing around **[Grudle Bay Riots](https://www.facebook.com/#%21/group.php?gid=175689658588 \"Grudle Bay Facebook\")**, or Abingdon-based duo **Nathan Allsworth** and **Tom Hodges**. The pair function as the linchpin of a fluid musical collective – occasionally they might be joined by **Alphabet** drummer **Paul Davidson**, **[Winchell Riots](http://www.thewinchellriots.co.uk/ \"They're also named after some riots...contentious?!\")** (oh look, another ace Oxford band…) sticksman **James Pamphlion**, drum machinist (and sibling) **James Allsworth**, or keyboardist **Tom Dyson**. In any case, new track _Fool Around_ marries understated glitch to some gorgeous delay antics, by way of a soulful, chilled out vocal. I’m seriously looking forward to more output from these guys, and hopefully after hearing _Fool Around_, you will be too.\n\n [Fool Around- Live from the bedroom](http://soundcloud.com/grudlebayriots/fool-around-live-from-the) by [Grudle Bay](http://soundcloud.com/grudlebayriots)",
