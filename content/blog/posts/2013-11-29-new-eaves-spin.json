  "body": "I spent a disproportionate amount of my youth listening to the likes of Alexi Murdoch, Elvis Perkins, and Willy Mason.\n\nI had grown to assume it had been a passing phase, in which my own teenage angst was translated to lyrical acoustic music, most of which I’d still wager wasn’t too questionable.\n\nHowever with the introduction to Eaves, I’ve completely regressed. His latest track, ‘Spin’, is a truly beautiful and utterly composed effort that is destined to be adored by an ever growing audience. Finding it’s strength in it’s seeming simplicity, Eaves has created a track that would sink into the heart of even the most stoic individual.\n\nPerforming next week at St Stephen’s Church in London, in support of Vance Joy, Eaves is an artist you must see live.",
