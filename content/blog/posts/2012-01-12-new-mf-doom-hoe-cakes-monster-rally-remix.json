  "body": "Gotta admit, **Monster Rally** is a good-vibe genius.\n\nHe’s a head above a lot of other instrumental beatmakers – maybe he can’t make that many good starts-and-ends to his tracks, but he can sure create smiles. His charming edits of **MF DOOM** tracks continues, this time with a fan classic from the 2004 album _MM..FOOD._\n\nRetaining the beatbox (why get rid of it?), he layers harps and atmospheric vocals in place of the original samples. These edits bring a new charm to already charming tracks – if you haven’t before, try his versions of **DOOM**‘s _[Change The Beat](http://monsterrally.bandcamp.com/album/gooey-gum-drops)_ and _[Vomit](http://monsterrally.bandcamp.com/album/mf-doom-vomit-monster-rally-remix-single)_. Hope there’ll be more of these, they’re a treat when they appear out of nowhere. Charming.\n\n_Listen to Monster Rally’s remix of Hoe Cakes below_.",
