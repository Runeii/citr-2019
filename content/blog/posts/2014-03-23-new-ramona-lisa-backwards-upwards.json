  "body": "Upon first listen, I couldn’t quite get my head around _Backwards and Upwards_, the new track from Brooklyn songstress **Ramona** **Lisa**.\n\nPerhaps it was the dissonant synths or the off – kilter electro pop vibe, but as soon as the ethereal voice of **Chairlift’s** Caroline Polachek kicks in, it proves to be one hell of a trippy and exciting listen.\n\nCheck out the lyric video for _Backwards and Upwards_ below.",
