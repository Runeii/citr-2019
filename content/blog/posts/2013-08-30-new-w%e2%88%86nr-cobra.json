  "body": "**W∆NR** are my favourites, partly ‘cus when I first read the name I thought that perhaps they’d missed out the K and were being cool-crude.\n\nHaving released their debut EP just a matter of weeks ago, they’re already churning out new material, in the form of _Cobra_. So there’s still a slight rigidity to their music that will fade over time and as they gain more experience, but the songwriting and overall composition is some of the best around at the present moment, and when mixed with the exquisite vocals, makes **W∆NR** one 2013’s finest new artists.",
