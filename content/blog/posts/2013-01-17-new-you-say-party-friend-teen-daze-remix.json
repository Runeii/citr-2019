  "body": "There are few stories as heartbreaking as that of **You Say Party**.\n\nFormerly known as **You Say Party! We Say Die!** the Canadian group experienced relative success in mid-00’s, with festival slots in the UK and four studio albums. However, their rise was tragically cut short in 16 April 2010, when during a performance at The Rickshaw theatre in Vancouver, drummer Devon Clifford collapsed on stage and died two days later in hospital. Dropping the We Say Die! from their name, the group attempted to continue without Clifford, however called it a day in April 2011, announcing they were going on an indefinite hiatus.\n\nNow, almost two years on, the group have returned with a beautiful ode to the late Devon Clifford, a fragile number titled _Friend_, penned by lead singer** Becky Ninkovic**. Spacious and openly emotional, it’s a fitting tribute to a life that came to an end far too soon. Check out _Friend_ below, as well as a remix from **Teen Daze**.",
