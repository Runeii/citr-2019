The **Dilla** influences are prominent as well, especially during the mid-section breakdown in _Deer And I_, yet the track manages to develop it’s own, slightly psychotic personality. Oh, and the cover art is one of the best of the year thus far.\n\nCheck out _Deer And I_ below, and download it for free.\n\n [Deer and I.](http://soundcloud.com/skruncha-roo/deer-and-i) by [skruncha-roo](http://soundcloud.com/skruncha-roo)",
