  "date": "2013-01-31T18:35:43",
  "body": "It’s been a while since we last checked in with moody London songwriter **Jamie Isaac**, and I’m taking that radio silence as a sign of more material in the works.\n\nThis live take of _Hollow Words_, comes accompanied by visuals shot over the course of last year, and just like the track itself are minimal and ever-so-mysterious. Having yet to put out a physical release, surely 2013 is the year that Jamie Isaac moves out of the bedroom and onto the big stage.",
