With this album receiving a UK release in May, the band are already well on their way to completing their follow up. They also show a new depth to their music when performing live – the four of them create a large, atmospheric sound with guitars and synths, topped off by some truly remarkable drumming. They might not be one of the most well known bands on the bill (even Standon Calling have got their name wrong, including the apostrophe that is ommitted in Norwegian), but Harrys Gym are definitely a force to reckon with.\n\n[Check Out Harrys Gyms’ Myspace!](http://www.myspace.com/harrysgym)\n\n[Buy Tickets For Standon Calling!](http://www.standon-calling.com/)",
