  "body": "With tomorrow’s show at the **Tufnell Park Dome** fast approaching, art-noise duo **Hype Williams** have released a new track that possesses a far more melody rich sound, perhaps hinting at a more approachable feel to their next LP.\n\nWith _Galice_, the pair have come closer to perfecting the damaged trip-hop sound that so often hesitated in the murky middle ground within their earlier work. The track is still crawling with ideas, textures and tones, with a narrative that still very much exists in the world of metaphysics, this time however it can at least be imagined.\n\n_Galice_’ is taken from the pair’s forthcoming _London 2012 _tour CD, it will be available at tomorrow’s show. All tickets are on the door, which open at 9pm, get down early to avoid disappointment.\n\nvia [No Fear of Pop](http://www.nofearofpop.net/blog/hype-williams-galice)",
