  "title": "Premiere: Empara Mi – Wanderlust (Seramic vs Carassius Gold Remix)",
  "date": "2016-06-16T16:16:51",
  "body": "Over the past week or so, I’ve fallen head over heels for _Wanderlust_, the debut track from **Empara Mi **\\-it’s smooth, ambitious and intoxicatingly emotive.\n\nLed by one of the finest vocal top-lines I’ve heard in recent times, and whilst only just over two minutes in length, it’s more than enough to suggest that Empara Mi is well worth keeping tabs on. This slightly more upbeat remix comes courtesy of **Seramic & Carassius Gold**, tellingly isolating the vocal as the strongest element of the track, whilst dropping in some Prince indebted funk. Check it out below, alongside the original version.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
