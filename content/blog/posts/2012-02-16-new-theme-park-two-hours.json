  "body": "I’ve seen London buzz band **Theme Park** described as ‘the new Talking Heads’; I’m not sure I’d go quite that far, but they are slowly but surely building up a nice little locker of tunes to pick from.\n\nNew single Two Hours premiered on **Huw Stephen’s** late night BBC show earlier this morning, and is less frenetic affair, and by far the groups most melancholic outing too date. With an album out later in the year, you can guarantee this won’t be the last we hear from the quirky four piece.",
