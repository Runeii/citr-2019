The list is as long as my arm, from the stylish remixes from **[James Blake](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/4358-review-james-blake-james-blake/ \"Review: James Blake – James Blake\")**, to the work of **The Weeknd** or **[Apache Jackson](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002635724544)**; it seems that the world has finally woken up to the fact that Rn’B could, can and will be more than what most hear on the radio. To say that these are exciting times for the genre would be a gross understatement.\n\nWith any luck **[The Drum](http://soundcloud.com/the-drum)** will be the next name to add to the ever-growing list on my arm. Made up of Brandon and Jeremiah of Chicago, the duo makes deeply atmospheric slow jams. Perhaps borrowing from some of the atmosphere found in **[The Weeknd’s](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/10287-new-the-weeknd-thursday/ \"New: The Weeknd – Thursday\")** tracks, the result is a psychedelic soul train that caresses and seduces the ear; it’s beautiful to listen to while being simultaneously menacing.\n\nListen to all of **The Drum’s** releases below.\n\n [Omar](http://soundcloud.com/the-drum/omar) by [THE-DRUM](http://soundcloud.com/the-drum)\n\n [Falling](http://soundcloud.com/the-drum/falling) by [THE-DRUM](http://soundcloud.com/the-drum)\n\n [Icy Tropics](http://soundcloud.com/the-drum/icy-tropics) by [THE-DRUM](http://soundcloud.com/the-drum)",
