  "body": "Took me until **K.**\n\n**I.D.’s** second song, _Drunk Enough To Love Me_, to get my head around the duo (Kara Lane and Bobby Kaoom). It’s grunge-y, it’s dance-y, it’s pretty undefinable really, but certainly filled with potential. They’re definitely very much fitting for a specific mood; I’d probably go crazy and singalong to every word if I was a few beers down. Check out their debut track, _I Wish I Was Your Cigarette_, alongside the video, below.",
