  "body": "You know that a buzz band has reached a whole new level of hype when as soon as they announce a new track/album/tour etc, they immediately begin trending on Twitter.\n\nThe Brooklyn folk quartet unleashed their new track _Sleeping Ute_ earlier this evening, as well as revealing plans for their forthcoming record and a host of worldwide shows. Now, I’m yet to be completely sold on **Grizzly Bear**, but from a few listens to this track it appears they’ve ditched the more intimate quality found on previous records, and adopted a more stadium rock approach. Check out _Sleeping Ute_ below, taken from their as yet untitled fourth album, out 17 September, more info [here](grizzly-bear.net).\n\nSEPTEMBER  \n16 Knoxville, TN @ Tennessee Theater  \n17 Atlanta, GA @ The Tabernacle  \n18 Nashville, TN @ Ryman Auditorium  \n20 Washington, DC @ 9:30 Club  \n21 Washington, DC @ 9:30 Club  \n22 Boston, MA @ Orpheum Theater  \n23 Montreal, QC @ L’Olympia  \n24 New York, NY @ Radio City Music Hall  \n26 Toronto, ON @ Massey Hall  \n28 Cincinnati, OH @ MidPoint Music Festival  \n29 Champaign, IL @ Pygmalion Music Festival  \n30 Chicago, IL @ Riviera Theatre\n\nOCTOBER  \n01 Minneapolis, MN @ First Avenue  \n04 Portland, OR @ Keller Auditorium  \n05 Seattle, Washington @ Paramount Theatre  \n06 Vancouver, BC @ Commodore Ballroom  \n09 Oakland, CA @ Fox Theater  \n10 Los Angeles, CA @ Greek Theater  \n17 Gateshead, UK @ The Sage Gateshead  \n18 Manchester, UK @ Academy  \n20 Glasgow, UK @ Barrowland Ballroom  \n21 Coventry, UK @ Warwick Arts Centre  \n22 London, UK @ Brixton Academy  \n26 Oslo, Norway @ Rockefeller  \n27 Stockholm, Sweden @ Berns Salonger  \n28 Copenhagen, Denmark @ Falconer Salen  \n30 Hamburg, Germany @ Uebel & Gefärlich  \n31 Berlin, Germany @ Astra\n\nNOVEMBER  \n02 Köln, Germany @ Essigfabrik  \n03 Paris, France @ Pitchfork Festival  \n04 Brussels, Belgium @ Ancienne Belgique  \n05 Amsterdam, Holland @ Paradiso  \n20 Wellington, New Zealand @ Opera House  \n21 Auckland, New Zealand @ Bruce Mason",
