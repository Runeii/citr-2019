It was one of those tracks that made you sit back and say, _“fuck, this is just….great”_. It didn’t necessarily get me in a tizz the first time around, but the more and more I listened, the more I _kept_ on listening. It is what it is; timeless, uncomplicated, one of those tracks that makes you appreciate good old-fashioned song writing more than ever.\n\nTheir follow up to the [Italian Beach Babes](http://italianbeachbabes.bigcartel.com/) release doesn’t have ‘SINGLE’ written all over it like _‘Ritual Confessions_’ did. Regardless, it’s mellow and heartfelt and sports a much more cavernous sound, thanks mostly to some wonderful harmonies.\n\nStream the track below.",
