  "body": "Hailing from New York, four piece [**Uncles**](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Uncles-Music/143845825631282) create glorious indie-folk, vaguely reminiscent of **Band of Horses** and **Fleet Foxes**. New track, _Bayberry Lane_ is taken from their upcoming sophomore album, and plays heavily upon the softly delivered vocals and gradual epic crescendo. The quartet have also just released a video for the song, directed and shot by **Charles Griffin Gibson**, there’s plenty of bleak inner-city imagery and shots of the band in their rehearsal space, proving fitting fairly well with the downbeat atmosphere of _Bayberry Lane_. Check out the clip below.\n\n[Uncles – “Bayberry Lane” (Music Video)](http://vimeo.com/33265031) from [Charles Griffin Gibson](http://vimeo.com/charlesgriffingibson) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
