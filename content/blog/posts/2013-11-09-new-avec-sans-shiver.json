  "body": "Few British outfits do electro-pop better than London’s **Avec Sans**.\n\nHaving taken their time to get this new single together, it’s fantastic to hear that it’s been more than worth the wait. Anthemic and instantaneously recognisable as their own unique sound, there’s elements of Purity Ring and CHVRCHES in their upbeat, early-00’s pop influenced vibe. Check out _Shiver_ below.",
