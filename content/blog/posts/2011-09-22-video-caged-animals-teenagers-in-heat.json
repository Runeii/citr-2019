  "body": "The video for the provocatively titled track, **_Teenagers in Heat_**, by Brooklyn 4-piece **[Caged Animals](http://cagedanimals.bandcamp.com/)** has been released onto the web. The video piece directed by **Mike McLean**, takes the form of a video collage made up of digital projections of the band over vintage footage, all combined using primitive digital techniques. The result is an off kilter mirage of images that clash, assumingly intentionally, with the lullaby like sounds of the track itself.\n\nWatch the new video below and check the band out in London supporting [Friends](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/11470-new-friends-im-his-girlmy-boo/ \"New: Friends – I’m His Girl/ My Boo\") on the 27th (**The Hoxton Square Bar and Kitchen**) and 28th (**The Shacklewell Arms**) of September.",
