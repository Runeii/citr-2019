I’d fully braced myself for **Lana’s** return to be a horrific, club ready ‘anthem’, like something Calvin Harris might crap out and have daytime Radio 1 fans humming for months on end, but West Coast is a rather nice surprise. So it’s hardly ‘experimental’ in the grand scheme of things (it’s not 12 minutes of white noise), but it’s perhaps not as outwardly ‘hit’ orientated as her debut album, whilst maintaining the gloriously cinematic feel that helped make her such a success.
