  "body": "This track from Surrey quartet **Softer Still** didn’t really grab me on first listen, however after adding it to our [Spotify New Music playlist](https://open.</p><p>spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02), I found myself coming back to it over and over again. It’s just the right sort of woozily romantic, and heavily 80’s indebted – we’re talking The Cure and Modern English, with a touch of the more recent and criminally underrated The Pains of Being Pure at Heart. In truth, you could place this track on one of the tapes that Jonathon makes for Will in Stranger Things and it wouldn’t seem out of place. Check out _Wishing Well_ below.",
