  "body": "[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/XJzgIfG.jpg \"Teeth\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/XJzgIfG.jpg)This hotly anticipated single is the debut second (damned press releases) release from psychedelic trio TEETH, out on Moshi Moshi at the end of this month. Electronic influences fused with punk inspired riot-grrrl vocals, makes Care Bear an invigorating and extravagant second single. Coming across like Blondie on acid, it’s an explosive slice of noise-pop, cementing their name amongst the most exciting acts of 2011. Their bizarre website echoes the vivid, flamboyant theme of the track, with hallucinatory images and eccentric videos scattered across the page at random. With TEETH gradually creeping onto the indie radar, this track is sure to further their career aspirations.\n\n [Care Bear](http://soundcloud.com/t3eth/care-bear) by [TEETH](http://soundcloud.com/t3eth)",
