  "body": "Dorset singer-songwriter **Alex Hedley** cut his teeth as the lead singer of the now disbanded Saturday Sun, and is now stepping out as a solo artist.\n\nHis four track debut EP released earlier this summer is a stirring mix of Ben Howard and Benjamin Francis Leftwich influenced folk-pop, centred around the emotionally poignant main track, _One Day_. Accompanied by a stunning animated video courtesy of Jeff Scherr, it’s real heart-on-sleeves songwriting, and hopefully the sign of great things to come from Hedley. Check out One Day below.\n\nFollow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
