  "date": "2015-03-31T19:21:27",
  "body": "Despite it being early in their career, UK production duo **TC4** are rapidly becoming a force to be reckoned with, and their latest offering, _Something About You_ is their most impressive release to date.\n\nPulling in the bewitching vocal talents of London singer **Arlissa**, it’s a track just itching to be dropped in night clubs around the country, alongside undoubtedly proving perfect for summer festivals. Lifted from an EP out 8 June, featuring the previously heard Tears (also available to check out below), it well and truly marks TC4 out as heavy hitters capable of rising above and beyond their contemporaries.",
