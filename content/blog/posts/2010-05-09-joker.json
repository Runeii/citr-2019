The 5th of May saw the arrival of **Joker** and **Foamo** at Newcastle’s infamous independent nightclub. Both played interesting sets, **Joker’s** Synth filled and pulsating, **Foamo’s** vibrant and ever changing. Despite the talent on display there was something missing; the night had no scene, no vibe and definitely no energy. Newcastle now has too many dubstep nights, all fighting for the illusive balance between ‘Raver’ and student. It’s just a shame that this particular night has fell victim to the over saturation. The whole thing felt disjointed and by the end of the night the place was nearly dead, much perhaps to **Joker’s** bemusement. The night’s promoters however are still giving **BEDBUG** another shot on October 13th, hopefully by then enough buzz will have been created to give this midweek night a vibe it deserves.\n\n[Joker’s Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/thejokerproductions)\n\n[Foamo’s Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/foamo)",
