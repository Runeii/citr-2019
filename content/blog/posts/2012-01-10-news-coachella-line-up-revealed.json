Earlier this evening they announced, via their [twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/coachella/status/156524587578957826/photo/1) page, the first set of acts due to feature at **Coachella** 2012. Including the likes of **Radiohead**, **The Black Keys**, **Bon Iver** and **Dr. Dre & Snoop** **Dogg**, as well as the newly reformed **At The Drive-In**, it’s quite rightly being regarded as the most expensive festival line-up in the world, if not in history. Check out the full list of acts set to play on the poster below.\n\nTicket information is available via the official [Coachella](http://coachella.com/) website.[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/AiwWSHmCIAAXlCI.jpg \"Coachella Line-up 2012\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13626-news-coachella-line-up-revealed/attachment/aiwwshmciaaxlci/)\n\n[Main image source](http://www.ryanpartnershipchicago.com/work/react5-coachella.html)",
