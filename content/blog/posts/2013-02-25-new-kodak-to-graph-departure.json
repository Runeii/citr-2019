  "body": "**Kodak to Graph’s** new single, _Departure_, released through Bad Panda Records, occupies the murky area between the sweaty, crowded dancefloor and the comforting, homely beanbag.\n\nNever quite opening out into a club friendly tune, nor relying entirely upon the ambient roots that it hints at, it’s glitch at it’s most glittery, elegant and composed. With **Mikey Maleki**, the brain behind Kodak to Graph planning on dropping one track a month across the course of the year, it’ll be fascinating to see how he develops and builds upon _Departure_.",
