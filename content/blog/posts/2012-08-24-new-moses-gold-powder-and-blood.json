  "body": "Manchester stands head and shoulders above the rest of the UK in so far as new music goes, yet there’s an underlying feeling that the Northern city almost needs a martyr; a icon to stand for what they believe in and to pour their heart over the downtrodden streets.\n\nWhile he may only have two tracks to his name, former **Christian AIDS** (**Stay +**) singer **Moses Gold** is vying for the crown, and reveals all in a hugely admirable interview with [The Line of Best Fit](http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/new-music/introducing/moses-gold-102744), discussing, amongst other topics, gender stereotypes, the modern stigma surrounding depression and the corruption and disregard shown by large parts of the music industry. As well as baring all, **Phil Young** also has unveiled a new track in the form of the 70’s inspired _Powder And Blood_, a dark, grueling affair, torn from under the finger nails of wasted, drug fueled nights and romanticized ideals.\n\n**Moses Gold** plays Manchester Soup kitchen on 30 August with **Esben and the Witch** – [here for tickets.](http://www.wegottickets.com/event/176029)",
