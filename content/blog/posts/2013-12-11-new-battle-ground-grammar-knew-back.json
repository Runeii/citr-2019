Back in October, he quietly dropped his debut EP _BGG_, a collection of tracks that moved with ease between groovy UK/garage vibes and soulful down-tempo serenades. The real surprise, though, came with the vagabond boogie anthem ‘Knew Back Then’, a wicked R&B sampledelia of pitched down vocals and tribal percussion that nurtures an unexpected dance floor sensitivity inside its crazy rhythm.\n\n**BGG** is available for free download [over here](http://battlegroundgrammar.bandcamp.com/).\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/110747205″ params=”color=ff6600&auto\\_play=false&show\\_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]",
