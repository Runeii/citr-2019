  "body": "As part of the iTunes Twelve Days of Christmas, London trio **The XX** have made a three track audio/visual EP available to download, featuring videos of two live performances and a previously unheard **Jamie XX** re-imagining of album track _Sunset_.\n\nDeviating from the almost conceptual theme of the LP, Jamie’s production focuses on building the narrative through the track, and utilizes his expertise with expansive percussion sections. First debuted at Boiler Room a few weeks ago, this is the first official airing of the remix. Check out the edit below, and grab the track [here](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/sunset-jamie-xx-edit/id583882367?i=583882483) as part of **_The xxmas EP_**.",
