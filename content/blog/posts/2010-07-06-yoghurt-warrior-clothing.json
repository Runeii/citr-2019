Thought so.\n\nAnd what’s even more thrilling is if this free stuff is actually worth having. Yoghurt Warrior’s new line of urban wear would definitely fall into that category; twisted, sadistic and surreal, the range definitely takes a slightly more disturbed stance on the images it depicts. But don’t let Winnie Wee Pants (A grotesque dribbling teddy bear) or Oink! (A slimy, fat, naked police man) put you off; this is a line that’s definitely worth feeling slightly disgusting for. So anyway, while I go sell out some more in the corner why don’t you go and check out Yoghurt Warrior’s online shop, with several items on sale there’s never been a better time.\n\n[Yoghurt Warrior](http://yoghurtwarrior.bigcartel.com/)",
