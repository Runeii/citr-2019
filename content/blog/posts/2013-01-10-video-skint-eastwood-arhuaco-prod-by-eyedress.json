  "body": "**[Eyedress](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/18385-new-video-eyedress-white-lies/ \"New & Video: Eyedress – White Lies\")** is an artist that’s been gracing our pages more and more over the last 2 months or so. Since his debut EP, he’s been producing more and more beats that, excluding a few exceptions, haven’t really floated my boat. This new cut though, a collaboration with **Skint Eastwood**, is getting it right. Full to the brim with tactile, satisfying and ultimately completely non-descript sounds, it rides a cheeky little melody holding hands firmly with a fuck-load of crunch.\n\nJust how i like it.\n\n[Skint Eastwood – Arhuaco (Prod. by Eyedress)](http://vimeo.com/56548206) from [EYEDRESS](http://vimeo.com/awesomer) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
