  "date": "2011-12-14T17:22:49",
  "body": "This cutesy little acoustic number comes courtesy of San Antonio five piece **Kites**, combining delectable lyricism with an Americana tinged undertone.\n\nFeaturing a stunning cello section and barely audible percussion, _How We Met_ feels like it should either be closing an album about a tumultuous love affair, or opening a record documenting the moving on from a relationship. With their full length record _**While The Dust Settles**_ currently in the works, it’ll be interesting to see whereabouts _How We Met_ fits in on the tracklisting and how the other tracks work about it. Check out _How We Met_ below and keep up to date with **Kites** via their [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Kites/255892044467?sk=info) page.\n\n<a href=\"http://kitestx.bandcamp.com/album/while-the-dust-settles\">While the Dust Settles by Kites</a>",
