  "body": "Of all the fantastic new artists emerging from Manchester, **Father Sculptor** are one of the standard bearers, excelling in both their music and their general approach to their art.\n\nHaving impressed with a collection of debut tracks mid-way through 2012, _Lowlands_ is their first full length track since said demos, and channels the spirit of early Jesus & Mary Chain and Felt. Aggressive, raw and emotional, there’s desolation, self-pity and sexuality expressed through their music, both epic and intimate at the same time. With a UK tour on it’s way, **Father Sculptor** have an extremely bright future ahead of themselves.",
