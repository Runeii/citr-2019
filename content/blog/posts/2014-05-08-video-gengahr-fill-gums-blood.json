  "body": "London outfit **Gengahr** cropped up briefly last year, and are now rearing their heads with their debut video for recent demo _Fill My Gums With Blood_.\n\nDirected by and featuring nine year old Nico Smith, it’s faux-gore, as imagined by a seemingly innocent mind. Having been out on the road with Wolf Alice and Superfood for a few dates earlier this week (caught them in Newcastle, they were fantastic), 2014 is set to be a mightily exciting year for Gengahr. Check out Fill My Gums With Blood below.",
