  "body": "I first came across Liverpool-based three piece **[Sun Drums](http://www.sundrums.co.uk/)** back in summer 2009, at the Jailhouse in Hereford. They weren’t called **Sun Drums** then, they were called **Bagheera**, but on first listens of the **_Sun Drums_** EP, released on October 1st via [Everybody’s Stalking](http://www.everybodysstalking.com/), it appears that their general musical outlook has remained much the same. Which is definitely a good thing, because **Bagheera** were rad, and as it turns out, so are **Sun Drums**. Fans of the likes of **Burial** and **Caribou** will certainly find something to love among the EP’s five tracks, which do a fine job of melding **William Bevan’s** ghostly two-step with the more blissful, organic sounds that **Dan Snaith** is famous for, all served up with a distant, soulful falsetto and the occasional six-string. Expect a full review of **_Sun Drums_** closer to its release date, but in the meantime, you can stream and preorder the EP via the Everybody’s Stalking [bandcamp](http://everybodysstalking.bandcamp.com/track/leaves-along-the-stream \"Everybody's Stalking Bandcamp\"), or listen to opening track _Leaves Along The Stream_ here.",
