  "body": "Since Introducing Manchester’s [An Blonds](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/16739-introducing-an-blonds/) a little under two weeks ago, I’ve yet to unearth any more significant details about the elusive group, aside from the fact that one or more of the members have been interviewed on _**CitR**_ under a previous guise. New cut _Creeps Into_ may well be their best yet, with it’s **Toro y Moi** synths and endearing vocal sections. It’s slightly introvert, psychedelic pop at it’s utmost enjoyable, complete with tinkling hooks and addictive harmonies. Check out _Creeps Into_ below.",
