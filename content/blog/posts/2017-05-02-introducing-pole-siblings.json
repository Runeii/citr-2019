  "body": "I’m such a sucker for Beach House style woozy indie-pop, and Finnish duo **Pole Siblings** (Sofia & Johan Stolpe) know exactly how to push my buttons.\n\nWith a solitary track on their Soundcloud, uploaded the best part of five years ago, they’re now gearing up to release their debut EP, featuring stunning lead track, _Ghosts_.

Check out Ghosts below.",
