  "body": "Having a sensually voiced woman spell out my name one letter at time is probably how I want my funeral to be, with lots of retired aspiring buzzbands crying in the pews, mourning the loss of their one chance at internet fame.\n\nAnyway, slightly perverted daydreams aside, this debut track from NY-based producer **Wildarms** portrays everything that’s so bloody brilliant about the  current crop of electronic producers, never ceasing to simply settle on one genre, _Full Hearts_ develops and blossoms on repeated listens. Choppy, ever-so bemusingly psychotic and undeniably interesting, **Wildarms** clearly enjoys his fair amount of hip-hop, yet refuses to be landlocked to any specific style. Check out _Full Hearts_ below, as well as [an interview with Dazed Digita](http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/15355/1/wildarms-full-hearts)l.\n\n_Full Hearts_ is taken from his debut EP **_Clear Eyes_**, out 5 February.",
