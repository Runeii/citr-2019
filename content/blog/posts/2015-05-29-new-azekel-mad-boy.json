  "date": "2015-05-29T12:48:18",
  "body": "East London has always been a bit of a breeding ground for new music, particularly that of the dark and sensuous R&B variety.\n\n_Mad About The Boy_, the latest track from Londoner **AZEKEL** is drenched in an unmistakable UK aesthetic, oozing the hazy and rich sound so well associated with the city. Recorded in his flat, the track has a distinct and personal feel that exudes a creative confidence that is pretty damn hard to ignore.\n\nMad About The Boy is taken from the first of his 2-part collection Raw, Vol.1 due out on the 12th of July.",
