  "date": "2014-12-17T01:37:48",
  "body": "Having been honing her craft since the age of 14, Australia’s **AYLA** is ready to hit the ground running.\n\nNow still only eighteen years old, she’s unleashed her startlingly mature debut single, _Wish I Was_. Having racked up a decent Youtube play count on the video (ignore the intro), alongside plays on Triple J, the wheels are starting to roll. Perhaps the most obvious comparison is Florence Welch, yet the songwriting and production feels more like Bastille or The Killers; dramatic and anthemic. Check out Wish I Was below.",
