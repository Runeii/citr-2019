An ingenious idea from Adidas leaves you with two functioning pairs of shoes, with the letters TF used to symbolize transform.\n\nThe shoes are now available in select stores, and I personally think they are some of the best kicks I have seen in a long time.\n\nBuy the trainers [here.](http://adidastrainers.org.uk/adidas-stan-smith-80s-tf-5/)",
