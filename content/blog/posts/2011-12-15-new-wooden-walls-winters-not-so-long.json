  "body": "This isn’t a ‘Christmas song’ as such, more a track built upon the gloomy confines of the season which we’re currently in.\n\nAnyway, _Winter’s Not So Long_ is appears to be quite folk influenced, but carves it’s very own sombre, brooding sound, allowing **Wooden Walls** to develop an entirely unique personality. Self-described on their bandcamp page as “_built in reverb. drowned in patch cables. wooden boxes and little voices_“, this particular number goes to show that not all aspects surrounding this time of year are completely shit.\n\n_Winter’s Not So Long_ is available for free download as part of a unique advent collection featuring drawings, short stories, exclusive music and much more, courtesy of [FIKA Recordings](http://www.fikarecordings.com/christmasinhaworth/).",
