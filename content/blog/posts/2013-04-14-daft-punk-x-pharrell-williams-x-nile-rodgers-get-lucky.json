  "body": "This has been doing the rounds since making a surprise appearance at Coachella, before the Yeah Yeah Yeahs set on Friday.\n\nIt’s pretty surprising: a sub-two minute advertisement, shot on a camera phone, from an off angle at a festival, and it’s already racked up over 200,000 views ([and a monkeys riding dogs remix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MAdAfZOiqg)…what?).\n\nBut this is Daft Punk, and we’ve waited 8 years since the last album (and some might argue 16 years since the last _solid _album), despite their profile having grown immensely in the interim years thanks to sell-out world tours.\n\nWithout wanting to extrapolate too much from 100 seconds of audio and [an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da_Yp9BOCaI) from the Daft Punk site, let’s just say that if this is an album of live instrumentation based 70s and 80s disco recorded with _god damn Nile Rodgers _then I’m A-OK with that.\n\nMay 21st can’t come soon enough, though.\n\nCatch a better quality version of the advert, from SNL last night, below.\n\nhttpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMJwcOiBoZE",
