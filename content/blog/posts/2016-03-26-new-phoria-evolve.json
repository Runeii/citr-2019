  "body": "**Phoria’s** Red, released way back in 2013, is still one of my favourite tracks that’s surfaced during the life of CitR.\n\nWhilst they’ve never quite reached that height since, their 2014 EP is solid for what it is; and with an album on the way this year, it’ll certainly be interesting to hear how it turns out. Their latest offering, _Evolve_, is a choppy affair, ethereal and otherworldly. Check it below.\n\nFollow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
