With his material released so far consisting of two bizarrely composed youtube videos of sampled footage, with his intricately composed, dance inspired music playing over the top. Islands (I Forgot) takes the listener on a surreal journey through a hazily arranged landscape, a track that needs to be heard to be truly understood. With a tape release entitled Geografia di Campania on the horizon, we were delighted to be able to convince Vittorio to put together an Exclusive Mix for us. Predominantly dance based, it’s an invigorating listen, and it also features a previously unheard Vittorio Mazzoni track, so without further ado, straight from Napoli, here is our thirteen exclusive mix.\n\n[Crack in the Road Exclusive Mix #13: Vittorio Mazzoni](http://www.mixcloud.com/crackintheroad/crack-in-the-road-exclusive-mix-13-vittorio-mazzoni/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=resource_link) by [Crackintheroad](http://www.mixcloud.com/crackintheroad/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=profile_link) on [Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=homepage_link)\n\n [Islands (I Forgot)](http://soundcloud.com/vittorio-mazzoni/islands-i-forgot) by [Vittorio Mazzoni](http://soundcloud.com/vittorio-mazzoni)\n\n[Check out Vittorio Mazzoni on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/voyagetoillumination)\n\n[Or over at his blog](http://vittoriomazzoni.blogspot.com/)",
