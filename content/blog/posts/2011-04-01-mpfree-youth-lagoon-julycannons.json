A student and musican, the 22 year old portrays a childhood innocence in his songs, yet they are hauntingly grounded and poignant, leaving  the listener intrigued and vunerable. His debut track, the elegantly fragile July, proved a hit within hours of being posted online, featuring on blogs like ourselves, as well as [Smoke Don’t Smoke](http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fsmokedontsmoke.com%2Fpost%2F4260621888%3Fref%3Dnf&h=89e14) and [No Modest Bear](http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nomodestbear.com%2Fblog%2Fyouth-lagoon%2F&h=89e14). With both tracks being stuck firmly on repeat since I received them, I’m delighted to be able to offer both July, and another new track, Cannons as free downloads. With production work from Jeremy Park and mastering from Lance Smith (Pandit) on top of a full length LP release set for this summer on Juno Beach Records, the buzz is rapidly buildinging around Trevor Powers. Youth Lagoon has touches of Perfume Genius with an anxiety and honesty lightly comparable to Elliott Smith, making both tracks truly moving listens. Download Cannons and July below.\n\n[Youth Lagoon – Cannons](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/stats/pepper/orderedlist/downloads/download.php?file=http%3A//www.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Cannons.mp3)\n\n[Youth Lagoo – July](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/stats/pepper/orderedlist/downloads/download.php?file=http%3A//www.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/July.mp3)",
