  "body": "Last time we covered **Dad Rocks!**, or Danish/Icelandic singer, guitarist, trumpeteer, father, and general all round good guy **Snævar Njáll Albertsson,** it was [in restless anticipation of the imminent release of his debut full length](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/9829-video-dad-rocks-mount-modern/ \"There's a really nice video there, too.\") **_Mount Modern_**. We have to wait until November 8th for that particular pleasure, but until then, it’s worth heading over to Dad Rocks!’ [bandcamp](http://dadrocks.bandcamp.com/album/big-scary-covers \"Macht schnell!\"), and getting your hands on his **_Big Scary Covers_** EP, which features four lovingly-crafted covers of some of the best acts on British indie mainstay Big Scary Monsters, namely **Kevin Devine, Tall Ships,** the much-missed **Colour**, and **Shoes and Socks Off**. Snævar will be taking down these covers sooner rather than later, so get ’em while you can!\n\nThe Dad Rocks! Tumblr can be found [here](http://dadrocks.tumblr.com/ \"I'm following him. Yeah, tumblr's cool. \"). Snævar also plays in the fantastically grin-inducing **Mimas**, who can be found [here](http://mimasband.tumblr.com/ \"Oh wow, another Tumblr. Getting right on that. \"). **_Mount Modern_** is up for preorder over at [the BSM website](http://bsmrocks.com/shop/ \"And other stuff, too.\").
