  "body": "With vaguely Barbara Kruger-esque artwork to accompany two seven minute plus tracks, it’s fair to say that **Future Trends** doesn’t do things in half measures.\n\nThe musical outlet of **Andrew Clark** from Ohio, there’s no denying the ‘chillwave’/modern production influences, yet there’s a psychedelic edge to **Future Trends** that few of his contemporaries manage to grasp. With the swirling, introductory track _In Your Arms_ leading into the gorgeous vocal led _Nothing To Fear_, it’s clear that these trio of tracks are a marked step-up from his previous work. Dreamy vocals and an undying sense of nostalgia dominate Nothing To Fear, sliding in somewhere between Wild Nothing and Washed Out, with a helping of Guillemots on the side. Check out the new three track release below, and his past releases over at [bandcamp](http://futuretrends.bandcamp.com/).",
