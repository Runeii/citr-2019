  "body": "In a world where we’re surrounded by shameless PR stunts, tedious marketing campaigns and pressurized into spending money we don’t have on items we don’t need nor want, it’s all to easy to get caught up in the endless dictated cycle, losing control of our own future.\n\nYet at the same time, genuine talent will always shine through, thus making it vitally important not to become overtly cynical, especially with new music (something that I openly admit to falling foul to from time to time).\n\nWrite, think or say what you want about **Aiden Grimshaw** and his time on X-Factor, it won’t detract from the talent possessed by one of the UK’s fastest rising popstars. New single _Curtain Call_ is everything we wanted to hear from **Grimshaw** when he first took to the stage infront of Cowell & Co; emotionally imposed, self-orchestrated and connected to **Aiden**, as opposed to the monotonously predictable cover songs he was chided into performing on the TV show. With the immaculate production and soaring chorus showcasing exactly what we can expect from his forthcoming debut LP _Misty Eye_, I’m not ashamed to say that the **Grimshaw** klaxon is sounding louder than ever, and I couldn’t be happier.",
