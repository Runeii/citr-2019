  "body": "Washington quartet **Gathered Ghosts**, who feature one quarter of **Craft Spells** (guitarist **Javier Suarez**), have just released their first new, non-demo material, in over a year, and it’s marked progression from their earlier work.\n\nHaving taken last year to expand from the solo-project of Suarez, into a fully-fledged four piece, _Maze_ and _Stay Where You Are (Pt. 2)_ drops the more jovial, pop-orientation that Craft Spells play with so well, and instead take up a darker, shoegazey perspective. There’s still the dreamy, not-quite-there quality, yet found amidst a far denser sound, and one that’s likely to win them a considerable number of fans over the coming twelve months. Of the two, Maze has blog-hit written all over it, check out both tracks below.",
