  "date": "2012-02-08T20:19:55",
  "body": "The Internet, combined with bedroom producing has made the age of modern artists decrease dramatically.\n\nRapper **[Haleek Maul](http://soundcloud.com/haleek-maul)** is 15 years old, that’s right, 15. I’ll give you a moment to feel thoroughly depressed.\n\nDone? Good, because **Haleek**’s music is something to get really fucking excited about. Ethereal and vast, perhaps the only thing that can match the instrumentation in terms of scope is **Haleek**’s flows. For someone so young they’re dramatically mature, “All the rhymes and the sins and lies I’ve told/Maybe I’m a demon, I think you should maybe hide your soul/told me, said she like it, don’t need life no more/what’s life my doll?”.\n\nJust, wow.\n\nStream the video by **[Jamie Harley](http://vimeo.com/user2751243)** below, featuring footage from the 1933 film _Lot in Sodom_, then check out **Haleek**’s earlier effort over a Clams Casino beat.",
