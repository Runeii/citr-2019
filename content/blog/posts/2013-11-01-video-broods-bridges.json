  "body": "From the same producer (Joel Little) as Lorde’s number one single Royals, comes NZ’s **Broods** with _Bridges_, one of the most captivating debut tracks of the year.\n\nHaving exploded on Soundcloud, racking up over 100k+ plays in a matter of weeks, the duo were quick to get working on a video for the track. Echoing the spacious, otherworldly feel to the song itself, it’s a fitting introduction to BROODS, and far from the last we’ll be hearing from them.",
