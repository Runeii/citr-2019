  "date": "2016-12-08T17:19:54",
  "body": "**oddnesse**‘s debut single _Somewhere Somehow _is the dream pop inspired take on shoegaze that you will need to help you through the holiday period.\n\nA driving 4/4 drum pattern lifts a fuzz soaked melody into a more up uplifting take on the usually somber genre. Bright vocals and gorgeous gentle, compelling instrumental passages, along with the aforementioned optimistic drum beat, take the track beyond a style often defined by copycat My Bloody Valentine esque production. This is especially prominent in the chorus where a soft glistening synth piece sits sympathetically under layered vocals that make the bands opening single shimmer. Definitely one to keep a close eye on going into the new year.",
