  "body": "Having created quite the stir with their two debut tracks, Lighthouse and Glow, Brighton’s **IYES** have cemented their place as one of the UK’s most exciting new acts.\n\nWith a set at CitR Live #001 last week, and forthcoming shows at Liverpool Sound City and The Great Escape, 2013 is shaping up pretty well for them. New track, _Daddy_, takes a step back from the slick-pop of their previous outings, and almost serves as an interlude to what’s to come. Entirely instrumental, there’s hints of Irish duo **Solar Bears** in the production and grandeur of the track, check it out below and grab a free download under that.",
