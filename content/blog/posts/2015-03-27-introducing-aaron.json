  "body": "Drawing inspiration from a host of the classic songwriters and composers, we’re talking Talking Heads, Kate Bush and Miles Davis, London’s **Aaron** has a pop edge to her music that almost comes as a surprise given the diverse range of influences she lists.\n\nHer debut EP, Letters To Jonny, is a potential filled offering, managing to build every track around a hook heavy chorus, managing to prove both energetic yet startlingly intimate at the same time. Check out the EP below, and catch her playing at Birthdays on Sunday.",
