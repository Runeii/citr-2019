  "date": "2013-03-12T16:28:25",
  "body": "_Close to the Equator_, the 2013 debut from South-London artist **SWW (Sarah Williams White)**.\n\nIt’s an odd little thing, part **Micachu** glitch mixed with smooth **Erykah Badu** like soul, yet despite pulling sounds and samples from several different styles and sources, **SWW** is remarkably confident in her execution. It’s easy to get along with, and with a pallet of sounds that seems to have more than a little bit of longevity we’re pretty certain you’ll be hearing a lot more from her.\n\nDownload the tune below and watch the track’s video while you’re at it.",
