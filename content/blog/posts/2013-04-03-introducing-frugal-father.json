  "body": "With a tag line ‘I don’t have any kids.\n\n’ and a name as tongue in cheek as **Frugal Father**, it’s clear this Colorado musician has a sense of humour. From his two debut tracks, _Red Headed Hipster_ and _First Trim_, his sound is purposefully hard to pin down, combining the raw emotion of **Casiotone For The Painfully Alone** with the ear for a melody that **LCD Soundsystem** perfected. Of the two, First Trim is the more measured number, almost like an electronic ballad for the 21st century blogger (NB. 20th century bloggers didn’t really exist, did they?). Check out his two debut tracks below, and keep up with Frugal goings on [via Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Frugal-Father/200487456697954?fref=ts).",
