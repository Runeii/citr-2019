Taking vocals from the chorus of the London bawler’s _He Won’t Go_, it doesn’t at all feel like he’s doing it purely for the sake of it, and instead they’re perfectly suited to the magical feel of _Won’t Go_. Transforming the track into a seductive R’n’B inspired number, **Dante Kinnunen’s** vocals provide a fitting contrast to the pitch-shifted vocals of **Adele**, backed by heavy, brooding synths and a minimal, dubbed beat. Check out _Won’t Go_ below.\n\n [Dante – Won´t Go](http://soundcloud.com/dantekinnunen/dante-wont-go) by [DanteKinnunen](http://soundcloud.com/dantekinnunen)",
