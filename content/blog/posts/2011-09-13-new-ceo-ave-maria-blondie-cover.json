But no, the record stands tall as an expression of love, or at the very least admiration toward the tennis star. The track is rather loosely a cover of **Blondie**’s **_Maria_**, but frankly the word ‘cover’ perhaps demeans the aim of the track. The sounds that we associate with **Ceo** are ever present, the folk sounds stretching through time zones in the most interesting of ways, it’s clear that **Ceo** was never intimidated by the sing he was recreating. Check out the tune below and watch the accompanying video while you’re at it.\n\n[ceo Ave Maria](http://soundcloud.com/modularpeople/ceo-ave-maria) by [modularpeople](http://soundcloud.com/modularpeople)",
