However while my mum remains blissfully unaware that this funny speaking DJ is much more than just that, **Crack in the Road** were lucky enough to have a brief interview with the man who has helped kick start the careers of the **Arctic Monkeys, The Wombats,** and **The Kaiser Chiefs,** amongst many others.\n\nFeeling somewhat nervous, this man had saved lives before (namely **Ryan Jarman**‘s at the **NME 2006 Awards**), I approached in a cautious yet determined manner that must have looked like a baby giraffe walking for the first time, only to discover they were born with only three legs. However such nerves quickly dissipated once the interview began with **Zane** expressing an element of jealousy over the voice recording facility on my iPhone, though something tells me he was taking the piss somewhat .. Authentic jealousy or not, I was talking to a pioneer of new music. We discussed how he had found the **Dot To Dot Festival**, with **Zane** immediately mentioning that **‘seeing Blood Red Shoes was a real highlight for me’.** This answer was somewhat unsurprising, especially as **Blood Red Shoes** were immediately next to us during the interview. Therefore I asked how the festival had varied over its habitation in the different cities, hoping to find some authentic opinions on a young urban festival.\n\nIn response to the festival’s first stopping point, Bristol, **Zane** talked about a lagging in energy when it came to his 1 am set, and while **‘Nottingham was insane from start to finish’,** he hoped that the settings of **FAC251** would provide a fantastic night. By this point I had realised that while I was listening to honest answers, his levels of professionalism were making it hard for me to gain any real insights into the mind of music impresario. Therefore I asked him about any new bands that the festival may have thrown onto his radar, **Zane** immediately responded with **Doorly**. For those of you not familiar with **Doorly**, he is an electro/dubstep DJ who started his career as a barman and took to the decks one night after a regular DJ failed to turn up. Now one of the hottest DJ’s around, it is no surprise that **Zane Lowe** is a huge fan. **Zane** commented on how **‘our styles are quite cohesive, we both play similar records in a similar style’**.\n\nAfter a few final remarks on his past Manchester gigs, with him describing his **Warehouse Project** gig as **‘absolutely amazing’**, my short time with **Zane** came to a swift end as a steadily growing group of fans began to congregate around us. However in those four minutes I had talked to a man who is one of the  biggest names in promoting and discovering new music, a well respected and hugely popular DJ, and the sole reason why **The Cribs** could continue to release albums. Not too bad for a **‘BBC Radio 1 DJ with a funny accent’**.\n\n[Zane Lowe New Music Website](http://www.zanelowe.com/)",
