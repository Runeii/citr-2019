  "body": "Set to be the b-side to upcoming single _Black Treacle_, **Arctic Monkeys** have released a hastily shot promo video for _You And I_, featuring close friend **Richard Hawley** on lead vocals.\n\nShowing the group laying down the track in a studio with the Sheffield crooner, it’s a very tongue in cheek affair, exhausting the quintessential worn down British cliches. The track itself continues in a similar vein to _**Suck It And See**_ material, proving extremely 60’s inspired complete with soaring guitar riffs and coarse vocals. Recorded under the **Death Ramps** moniker, it’s the first time the group have used this title since releasing a limited edition 7″ single back in 2008. Check out _You And I_ below, set to feature on _Black Treacle_, out 23 January.",
