  "title": "New: The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart – Simple And Sure",
  "date": "2014-02-27T15:31:03",
  "body": "Rejoice one and all, for The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart have not only announced a new album, _Days Of Abandon, _but have also released the first official single from the record.\n\nI’ll be honest, if you were expected a revolutionary new sound, you’re going to be disappointed. Wanting that from the group though is somewhat missing the point. They make gorgeous, catchy and evocative indie pop. That’s their niche and that’s what they’ve done with ‘Simple And Sure’.\n\nThe track is rich and beautifully layered. Upbeat and cheery, complete cooed “ohs” and “ahs” in the background, all in contrast to the darker lean of the lyrics. It’s three and a half minutes of pop purity.\n\nAll hail The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart – they’re finally back.",
