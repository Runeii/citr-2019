Despite the group technically being a four piece when they perform live, all the instruments on record are performed by Dylan himself, showcasing his immense talent and preference to do everything his own way. With his debut “proper” out earlier this month on Carpark Records, Crack in the Road caught up with Dylan to find out more about the record, his aspirations and plans for the rest of the year.\n\n_How did Cloud Nothings come about?_\n\n**Cloud Nothings started when I was in my first year of college. On breaks from school I would go home and record music, and one day I decided to make a Myspace page and make up a “fake” band (since it was just me). I chose the name Cloud Nothings, added a couple of blogs as friends on Myspace, and everything took off from there.**\n\n_What would you cite as your main influences, both musically and otherwise?_\n\n**My main musical influences are definitely bands like Husker Du, The Replacements, and Archers Of Loaf. Otherwise, the city of Cleveland is definitely an influence on my music…there isn’t too much else to do other than play music, so it’s kind of why I started playing in the first place.**\n\n_How would you describe your sound in your own words?_\n\n**Punk-pop.**\n\n_What plans do you have for releases and tours in 2011?_\n\n**There’s a new Cloud Nothings album coming out on January 25th on Carpark Records, and we’ll be touring with Toro Y Moi in March and playing some festivals more towards the summer.**\n\n_Other sites have described your music as “having a snarl” and “being vicious”, would you agree with this, and where does this anger come from?_\n\n**I don’t really think there’s too much anger in my music, no. To me it sounds upbeat and fun rather than angry. I make music because it’s fun for me, not because I have anger issues I can’t get out any other way.**\n\n_What was the first album you can remember falling in love with?_\n\n**They Might Be Giants’ first record.**\n\n[Cloud Nothings on Myspace!](http://www.myspace.com/cloudnothings)",
