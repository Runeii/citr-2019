  "body": "Absolutely love this debut video and song from London’s **DRELLER**.\n\nSound wise, it feels somewhere between the isolation and emotional exhaustion of How To Dress Well, and the slicker, yet equally as cutting grove of Chet Faker, and when accompanied by the stunning (I would say vaguely NSFW but c’mon, it’s animated) video done by DRELLER himself, it’s an imposing and impressive introduction. Check out _One Night Stand_ below.\n\nFollow our [Spotify On Repeat playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a hand-picked selection of the current hottest tracks.",
