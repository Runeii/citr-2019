  "date": "2014-03-26T15:25:21",
  "body": "One of my highlights of SXSW this year was watching multi-talented singer songwriter **Young & Sick** perform an acoustic set at an exclusive show in a Rainey Street penthouse.\n\nThe diversity to his sound is quite astonishing at times, and new track _Heartache Fetish_ showcases this. Previously described as ‘future soul’, it’s immersive and hard-hitting, whilst maintaining the pop sensibilities that will no doubt open his music up to a much wider audience. _Heartache Fetish_ is featured on his debut album, out 8 April via Harvest Records.",
