  "body": "It’s news to me, but Swiss producer of all things strange, known to Planet Earth as **Dimlite**, has been working hard on a third effort, and it sounds like it will be his most complete to date.\n\nFrom this new stuff you can already hear a strong Krautrock style, and the forecast reads strong squelchy synths with a touch of Beefheart love.\n\nOnce again, we’ll never know what he’s going on about, but that’s what makes him so brilliant. I worry about this new **Stones Throw** signing **Jonti** taking all the light, being a ‘fresh’ solo producer, but when I see out-of-your-mind videos like this being made, my conscience is clear. The guy’s a nutter, and I’m very much looking forward to _**Grimm Reality**_, out on CD, download and 3×10″ (with astounding artwork) on November 21st via **Now-Again Records**.\n\n_Watch the video for Fridge Note below._",
