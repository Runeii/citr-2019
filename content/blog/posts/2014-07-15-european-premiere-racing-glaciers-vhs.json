  "body": "With a fan base rapidly expanding with each single they release, Macclesfield quintet [**Racing Glaciers**](https://www.</p><p>facebook.com/RacingGlaciers) are one of the most exciting UK bands around at this moment in time. Achieving an almost unprecedented amount of [Hype Machine](http://hypem.com/search/racing%20glaciers/1/) success for a more traditional rock and roll outfit, alongside Radio 1 play for recent singles _First Light_ and _Moths_, they’re a surefire tip for colossal success in 2015. Newest track, _VHS_, is another explosive outing, centred around a riff that would see Royal Blood turn green with envy, and their hearts-on-sleeves approach to lyricism; this may well signal the beginning of a more mainstream breakthrough. Check out _VHS_ below and grab a free download from their [Music Glue](https://www.musicglue.com/racing-glaciers/) page, plus keep your eyes peeled for their third EP, out 18 August.",
