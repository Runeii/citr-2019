In part, it’s what attracted me to this new track from LA’s **Temme Scott** – the storytelling ability translates beautifully on _The Edge_, lyrically one of the finest tracks I’ve heard for quite some time. The Edge is lifted from her recent EP, First. Check it out below.\n\n_I want to hate you but sometimes it’s hard / I wish I could speak without dropping my guard_",
