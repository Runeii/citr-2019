  "body": "Nashville’s **Lonely Benson** has been a staple feature of our [Spotify New Music](https://open.</p><p>spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) playlists over the past few months, with his ‘one track a month’ schedule seeing him already clocking up an impressive online following. His latest, _Moonstone_, is a more romantic, chilled out affair than the more pop-orientated previous tracks Lazy Lover and Peculiar Paradise. Relatively simple production and some delicately lovelorn songwriting merge beautifully, to make it a solid five from five for LB. Check it out below.",
