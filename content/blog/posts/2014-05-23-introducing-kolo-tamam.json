  "body": "From the Arabic phrase roughly translated as ‘Everything is cool / All OK’, Manchester six piece **Kolo Tamam** instil much of this easygoing, laid-bak attitude into their music.\n\nWith four track currently sitting on their Soundcloud, although a couple more disappeared a month or so back, their sound is as diverse as it is at times atmospheric (_Intermission_). Their newest composition, _Mesophase_ (yet another imaginatively relevant title) is their strongest yet, combining Alt-J like rhythms with a knack for finding a killer melody, and suggests that there’s some serious songwriting talent here. Check out a selection of their material below.",
