Not only does it allow me the consolation that perhaps someone else has felt similarly to me before, it provides an avenue for creative thought, alleviating cumbersome musings I may have been experiencing otherwise. This is certainly, the case of this weeks Single of the Week, which has kept me going through what has otherwise been a near insurmountable week.\n\nPandit’s Pack Your Bags is a beautiful ode to failing love, harrowing and hopelessly honest. “I’m not the kind that you want to bet on, but I’ll love you always it’s true” weeps Lance, with an integrity appealing alluring. Aside from the track being a hauntingly moving creation, the video by Tyler T Williams is realised perfectly, elegantly capturing the essence of the song.",
