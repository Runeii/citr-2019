  "body": "We’d been waiting so long for the return of **Vallis Alps** that I’d started to doubt they were coming back at all.\n\nTheir immaculate 2015 self-titled EP propelled them to blogcore buzz-stardom, and slew of live shows followed, including a trip to SXSW earlier this year, new music from the duo was proving elusive, until this week with the release of _Fading_. Another super slickly produced, electro-pop number, there’s elements of Purity Ring, Shura or Maggie Rogers to the ethereal elegance that the duo conjured up. Worth the wait? You bet. Check it out below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
