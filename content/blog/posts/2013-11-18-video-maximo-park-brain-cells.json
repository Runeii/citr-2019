  "body": "This is somewhat of a change of direction from North East quintet **Maximo Park**, stripping back the brash guitars that characterised much of their early output, and opting for a more refined approach, that harks back to the more composed moments of their second album _**O****ur Earthly Pleasures**_, rather than their 2012 LP _**The National Health**_.\n\nLifted from their fifth album, **_Too Much Information_**, set for release at the beginning of Februrary 2014, _Brain Cells_ merges the intelligent, cutting lyricism of Paul Smith with far more up to date, dare I say, blog-pop inspired instrumentation. From the smooth synths to the programmed drum-machine, it’s quite unlike anything they’ve done before, and it’s absolutely brilliant.",
