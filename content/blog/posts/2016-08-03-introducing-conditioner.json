  "body": "There’s nothing better than when a new artist arrives with a pretty much fully realised sound.\n\nLA duo **Conditioner** showcase a distinctively catchy vibe on their two debut tracks, the upbeat _That’s Not Me_ and the more melancholic _Under Water_. A nod to a track lifted from Beach Boys’ Pet Sounds, it’s an influence that is worn on their sleeves – simple chords, coherent song structures and a knack for finding a killer hook. There’s more than enough here to suggest a very bright future for Conditioner.\n\nLike this?
