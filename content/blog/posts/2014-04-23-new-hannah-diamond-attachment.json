  "body": "Just over five months since Hannah Diamond arrived with the release of her debut track ‘Pink and Blue’, she returns with her sophomore effort ‘Attachment’, and it does not disappoint.\n\nFollowing on from Josh’s [brief analysis](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/24995-new-hannah-diamond-pink-blue/) of ‘Pink and Blue’, Diamond’s extension into ‘Attachment’ is a seamless development of the bubblegum pop aesthetic that is still galvanzied by a wonderful element of satire. With a more extrapolated song structure and a greater vocal range, there are even moments that are reminiscent of Kate Bush’s ‘Wuthering Heights’.\n\nCould this be the greatest example of meta pop yet? We’re still trying to figure it out, however in the meanwhile ‘Attachment’ is an infectious track that will only increase the intrigue surrounding this exciting young PC Music artist.",
