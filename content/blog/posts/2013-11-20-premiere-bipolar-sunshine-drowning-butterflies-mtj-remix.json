  "body": "Bipolar Sunshine has been on our radar over here at CITR for about a year now and he has continued to please with his just released EP–Drowning Butterflies.\n\nToday we got our hands on a mesmerizing remix of the EP title track by Maths Time Joy. MTJ quickens the tempo, layers the synths and distorts the vocals to create a club ready track that still maintains all the bits that make Bipolar Sunshine so damn good. Think shiny synths, wobbling base, and, aptly, sunshiny melodies. I dare say its impossible not to groove to this.\n\nBipolar Sunshine will be bringing some much needed light to London tonight as he headlines a show at Electrowerkz where I’m expecting to shake away the Wednesday slump!\n\nElectrowerkz tickets [here](https://www.stargreen.com/bipolar-sunshine-9999.html) (if there’s any left)\n\nDownload Drowning Butterflies [here](http://bipo.la/DrowningButterfliesSC)\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/120900148?secret\\_token=s-ZX2JI” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]",
