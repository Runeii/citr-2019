  "date": "2013-07-19T13:04:13",
  "body": "Sam Thomas, the English multi-instrumentalist, has released another cut from his second single, ‘Gifts’, the haunting and ethereal ‘Blue Cologne’.\n\nWhile ‘Gift’ has a strong post-rock vibe, ‘Blue Cologne’ has the artist exhibiting his Classical chops.\n\nThe track is intricately put together, with the instruments washing and weaving over one another. There’s a tension bubbling underneath ‘Blue Cologne’, giving it enough edge to avoid slipping into tedium, while remaining a pleasant listen.\n\nYou can give the track a spin below, maybe even grab a pair of headphones and chill in the sun. Sam Thomas’ debut album, _Blind Theatre_, is coming out soon on Just Music and you’ll be able grab it at the usual places. Peace.",
