Whilst initially I had a few reservations about the slightly cheesy nature to it, I found myself returning to it again and again – grabbed by the slick production and no frills songwriting. Now accompanied by a fittingly refined video, the ambition here is striking, and with a few more songs like this, there’s no limit how far Hylom could go. Check out _I Won’t Forget_ below, lifted from his debut EP, _**My Own Anxieties**_, out now.",
