  "body": "Had this one open in a tab for a week or so now, trying to get my head around whether I love it or hate, and fairly sure I’ve finally come to a decision now.\n\nSo there’s elements of multi-million selling artists like Ed Sheeran, Paolo Nutini et al to **Kid Trench’s** debut offering, _Blue Skies_, yet there’s also more tender, sincere touches, as one might expect from SOHN or James Blake. Only a couple of dozen plays on his Soundcloud so far, it’s clearly very very early stages, but once you see past the slightly cheesiness, this is a mightily impressive debut. Check out Blues Skies below.",
