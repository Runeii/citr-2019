But don’t expect an inferior clone of **Jeff Mangum’s** songwriting – **A Hawk and a Hacksaw** play Balkan-tinged folk music filled with trumpets and accordions with vocals used sparingly. They represent what Standon Calling is all about – they produce a clearly unique sound, vastly different to most things on the Standon Calling bill, and, on a Friday where you will be darting from the hardcore punk of **Fucked Up** to the minimal electronics of **Pantha Du Prince**, they are yet another example of the vast wealth of the Standon Calling line up as they headline the Crooked House stage.\n\n[Standon Calling Website](http://www.standon-calling.com/)\n\n[A Hawk And A Hacksaw’s Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/ahawkandahacksaw)",
