  "body": "Danish pop music is in a pretty great place right now, what with MØ conquering the charts and indie darlings Liss winning numerous tastemaker fans.\n\nOn their debut track, _CityLights_, Electro-pop duo **mono mono** (Karoline Elsig and Jakob Franck) showcase more than enough potential to suggest that they could be the next act from Denmark to hit the big time. Uber-cool, almost ANOHNI-esque at points – CityLights is gloriously romantic and intoxicatingly addictive.
