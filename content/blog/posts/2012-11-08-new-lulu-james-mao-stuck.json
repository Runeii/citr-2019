  "body": "North East songstress **Lulu James’** meteoric rise to fame continues, as she drops her new track _Stuck_ featuring **Mao**.\n\nThere’s a real 80’s soul vibe going on as well as the obvious comparisons to **Janelle Monae**, it’s further proof that this young singer has a very bright future ahead of herself. The beat is glitchy and as dubstep inspired as previous outings, yet it’s the vocals that really make the difference, most notably the echoed production that adds a  fantastic extra dimension to the track.",
