  "body": "Hailing from North London, Fredwave has been on our radar since he dropped his impressive previous offering ‘Change’ earlier in the year.\n\nSince then he has received plaudits from the likes of BBC Radio 1xtra, Noisey, and SBTV, and has taken the time to further hone his sound.\n\nWith ‘Kno Betta’, Fredwave has provided us with a dark, striking video to accompany the themes of fear and tragedy that exist throughout the track. Directed by Marco Grey, the video touches upon very real issues that exist for young people growing up in London, while intertwining Fredwave’s own worlds of love and regret, leaving the finished product as a must watch from beginning to end.",
