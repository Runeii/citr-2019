A relatively new cassette based label, started by mates Dwight and Jheri, both esteemed bloggers and tastemakers, it’s already gaining quite a name for itself. With new releases going up for pre-order later this week, including previous CitR featured artist Two Bicycles, as well as a new record from SPORTS, it’s fantastic to be able to get an insight into what’s coming up over the next couple of months over at Crash Symbols. Featuring tracks from the likes of Teen Daze, fresh from their awesome SXSW shows, as well a track from Coma Cinema’s new record Blue Suicide, and that’s not even mentioning Technicolor!, an epic new track from Nothern Ireland experimental aritst The Cyclist. Be sure to check out the mix below, as well as to head over to [Crash Symbols](http://crashsymbols.tumblr.com/) to check out some of their other releases!\n\nImage courtesy of Liz Toler – www.figandfox.tumblr.com\n\n[Citr Exclusive Mix #5: Crash Symbols – Big Tongue Candy Mountain](http://www.mixcloud.com/crackintheroad/citr-exclusive-mix-5-crash-symbols-big-tongue-candy-mountain/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=cloudcast_link) by [Crackintheroad](http://www.mixcloud.com/crackintheroad/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=profile_link) on [Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=homepage_link)",
