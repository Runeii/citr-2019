  "body": "Having staggered across [**Miyuki’s**](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/17862-introducing-miyuki/) music a week or so ago, I’ve been utterly enthralled by the Russian producer. With all her back catalogue downloaded and the play counts rapidly rising, it’s fair to say that I’m falling head over heels for her emotionally connected dubstep, as are others it would appear. When I introduced her music to one of my favourite bloggers, he simply replied “where did u find miyuki i’m crying this is so good”, and it’s a true testimony to the strength and transcendental ability that **Miyuki** conjures up. Check out her latest track below – _Sublime Moments_, another collab with **Jan Amit**.",
