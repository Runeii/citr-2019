  "body": "This new track from Colorado’s **Galaxies** may well be the finest pop track of the year so far.\n\nSure it’s no game changer, but once you get lost in those glorious harmonies and effervescent synth’s you’ll soon forgive that. Coming in somewhere between **M83** and **Washed Out**, _Sailing_ is grounded by it’s simplicity and unforgettable chorus; this is the comeback song that **Miike Snow** wish they’d written. Stream _Sailing_ below, and check out **_Letters From Sea_** when it drops on 22 January.\n\n [Galaxies – Sailing](http://soundcloud.com/yvynyl/galaxies-sailing) by [yvynyl](http://soundcloud.com/yvynyl)\n\nStream courtesy of [yvynyl](http://yvynyl.tumblr.com/)",
