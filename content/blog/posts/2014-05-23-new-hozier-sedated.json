  "body": "Irish dreamboat **Hozier** is all set to take over the world.\n\nWith appearances on Letterman and Ellen within the past couple of weeks, as well as proving one of the must see artists of SXSW, he’s gearing up for a big summer of festivals, and has released new track _Sedated_ as his second official single. Another twist on his own bold, over-the-top brand of pop orientated folk music, his album, expected later in the year, will undoubtedly see him well and truly breaking into the mainstream.",
