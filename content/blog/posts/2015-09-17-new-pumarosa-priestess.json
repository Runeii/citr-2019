  "body": "Was lucky enough to hear this new track from **Pumarosa** a little while ago, being blasted through car speakers on the way to one of this summers festivals, and it fit the setting perfectly.\n\nWindows down, driving away from London for a temporary release, I’ve no doubt that _Priestess_ will serve as a similar soundtrack for numerous people next festival season. A sprawling, seven and a half minute psychedelic infused number, it’s completely immersive and intoxicating. Check it out below. Priestess is released by Chess Club on vinyl [here](http://www.thegenepool.co.uk/items/1564.htm).\n\nFollow our [Spotify On Repeat playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a hand-picked selection of the current hottest tracks.",
