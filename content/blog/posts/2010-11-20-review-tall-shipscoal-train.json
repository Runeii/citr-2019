  "body": "Formed out of the remnants of **This Ain’t Vegas**, **Coal Train** rise form the ashes as a rock infused indie-pop four piece from **Sunderland**.\n\nKnown primarily, or at least in musical terms, as being the city that produced **The Futureheads**, **Coal Train** have produced a sound that is entirely, and wonderfully, different from their home town counterparts.\n\n‘**Building Dens**‘ saw **Coal Train**‘s first furore into the realm of released music under their new guise, gaining a great deal of attention from many bloggers and critics alike. However with their second single release, ‘**Tall Ships**‘, the band has produced a track wholly more upbeat and infectious effort that details a metaphorical journey down the **River Wear**. The track begins rather unassumingly, until a moment of choral vocals sparks into life jangly guitars and percussion, laced with a dose of light hearted piano which immediately engages the listener. However only seconds later, the track falls back into a period of quiet rest bite, before then moving back into a flurry of instrumental joy. These fluctuations echo the sentiment of the song, as these periods of differing tempo feel like water from a river lapping against a shore, or the differing in speed of water a river encounters as it transverses through different terrain. As a result, ‘**Tall Ships**‘ keeps the listener engaged by allowing them to be absorbed into the journey of the track, with lead singer **Richard Amundsen**‘s vocals narrating throughout the course. **Amundsen**‘s vocals on the track are driven yet personal, with a real sense of anguish combusted with a thankful relief, and ultimately acts as the final ingredient to a track that has the jovial nature of an indie-pop tune, with the integrity and gritty nature of a rock sound.\n\n8/10\n\n[Coal Train Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/coooaltrain)  \n[Coal Train Blog](http://www.coal-train.blogspot.com/)\n\n[COAL TRAIN – Tall Ships (free digital single)](http://vimeo.com/15922600) from [Coal Train](http://vimeo.com/user4715976) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
