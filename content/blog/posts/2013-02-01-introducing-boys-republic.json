  "body": "With a Curtis-esque drawl, Interpol style driven bass-lines and the scything wit more commonly associated with **The National**, Toronto trio **Boys Republic** comprised of **Ryan Kennedy**, **Jeremy Boyd** and **Shawn Bradley** may not be 100% unique, but that’s not to say that they don’t bring anything interesting to the table.\n\nTheir debut EP **_Rakish_**, the first in series of one EP a month this year, is four tracks that form a fitting introduction to the group. It’s a sound that has been mimicked countless times before, but it’s a mighty long time since I remember a group doing it as well as _Defamer_ or _Make You Happy_. EP highlight _Pictures_ is perhaps let down by low-budget production, yet the songwriting and lyrical ability shown more than makes up for the basic and at-times slightly rigid production. Check out the EP in full below, and grab a free download while you can.\n\n[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/boysrepublicmusic) / [Official Site](http://boysrepublicmusic.com/)\n\n_you carved into a sliver / __what once stood as a tree / __finally see the failure you see in me_",
