Fresh from announcing an extensive debut US tour with this years sensation **Baths**, **Star Slinger** has dropped another remix upon us, and it’s as exciting as ever. Touches of **The Avalanches** in this rework of **HeRobust’s** _Grief Case_, Darren’s Midas touch prevails once again, creating an atmospheric and distinctive tune. Having already created one of the songs of the year with his remix of **Coolrunnings** _I Am You_, 2010 is proving to be a fruitful year for **Star Slinger**. Receiving numerous mentions on Pitchfork, Darren will be looking to increase his fanbase in the coming weeks, leading up to the release of his second full length release, Volume 2.\n\n [HeRobust – Grief Case (Star Slinger’s WWHRD Remix)](http://soundcloud.com/starslingeruk/herobust-grief-case-star-slingers-wwhrd-remix) by [Star Slinger](http://soundcloud.com/starslingeruk)",
