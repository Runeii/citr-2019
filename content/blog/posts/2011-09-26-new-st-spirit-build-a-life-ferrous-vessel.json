  "body": "**St.**\n\n**Spirit** are hardly reinventing epic indie-pop, yet there’s something rather adorable about these two tracks from the London outfit. Stating one of my all time favourite records as a major influence, in the form of **My Bloody Valentine’s** _**Loveless**_; it’s slightly bemusing then that these two tracks bare very little, if any resemblance to the classic 1991 album. However that’s not to say _Build A Life_ and _Ferrous Vessel_ aren’t worthy of praise in their own right. ‘A Side’ _Build A Life_ begins placidly before launching into a stomping three minutes of pulse-racing post-rock inspired indie; soaring guitars and crisp vocals included. The chorus, consisting of _‘Come on son, you don’t know what you’re missing, sex, death and repetition blues.’_ proves distinctly memorable. Whereas _Ferrous Vessel_ is a slower, more calculated track; siphoning off the intensity found on _Build A Life_, echoing **Brand New** at times. Light comparisons could be drawn to **The Twilight Sad** and **Explosions in the Sky**, yet the most obvious act to draw a likeness between are Oxford’s **Spring Offensive**. Check out both tracks below, which are released as free downloads from tomorrow.\n\n<a href=\"http://stspirit.bandcamp.com/album/build-a-life\">Build A Life by St. Spirit</a>",
