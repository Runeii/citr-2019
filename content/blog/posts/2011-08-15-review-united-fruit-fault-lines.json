  "body": "OK.\n\nSo I have a confession to make. I am _massively_ late to the party here. **_Fault Lines_**, debut album from Glaswegians **[United Fruit](http://unitedfruit.bandcamp.com/album/fault-lines \"United Fruit Bandcamp\")**, dropped way back on May 30th. And as such I cannot write this review and pretend to be right at the cutting edge of modern music. However, I can and do write this review on the premise that someone might actually read it, and then listen to **United Fruit**, and then buy **_Fault Lines_**. If you’ve never been too comfortable with sunny psych-pop, don’t fully understand chillwave (I mean, really?!), and feel that there’s probably far too much reverb across the board, then you need **United Fruit.**\n\nFrom the moment that _Kamikaze_ opens fire in a hail of six-stringed, staccato shards, one thing is definitely clear. **United Fruit** are noisy. Guitars pushed screaming somewhere beyond overdrive fall away like cobwebs into sparkling chimes, before redoubling their attack. Vocals lie partially obscured by layers of distortion. Still, the band are a far cry from the most recent ‘loud’ reference point, that lo-fi wall of fuzz popularised by **No Age** or **Wavves**. Tracks like the pulsing _Red Letter_ are imbued with a punkish vibe more reminiscent of **Hot Snakes,** while album highlight _Go Away, Don’t Leave Me Alone_ announces itself with the kind of clanking, stop-start guitars that haven’t really been seen since the much missed **Pretty Girls Make Graves** were in their heydey\n\nFar from being unlistenable in its onslaught, **_Fault Lines_** plays to its strengths, embracing its raw volume and translating it into a more accessible energy. Both Iskandar Stewart’s and Stuart Galbraith’s vocals certainly carry something akin to a hook in places, particularly on the aforementioned _Go Away_, or the hip-shakin’ chant of ‘roll baby, roll baby, rock and roll!’ in _The Alarm_. At times the band’s aggression is tempered by a certain tenderness – _Three_ introduces a little vocal fragility to the proceedings, along with some comparatively gentle guitar, and a quick glance at the lyric sheet reveals a guarded heart-on-sleeve aesthetic that, for me at least, beats the hell out of songs about skating, weed, or not very much at all.\n\nPart of the appeal of **United Fruit** can be summed up in their skillful walking of one of those metaphorical tightropes that get trotted out so often. There’s certainly nothing kitsch or twee about the band, but similarly, there’s none of the growly, macho posturing that makes the large majority of the actual ‘rock’ scene so hard to swallow. Essentially, **_Fault Lines_** makes me want to pick up a guitar, plug it in, turn it up really loud, and jump around like a twat. And not much makes me want to do that any more. The album can be streamed and purchased via [bandcamp](http://unitedfruit.bandcamp.com/album/fault-lines), and you can find _Go Away, Don’t Leave Me Alone_ below, for your listening pleasure.",
