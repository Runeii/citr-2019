  "body": "**_‘You’d be surprised how expensive it is to look this cheap._**\n\n**_’_** Was the most flamboyant artwork I saw in 2012. This massive gleaming structure of sparkle filled with the pinkest inflatable flamingos and twinkling floor tiles dazzle the senses and turns anyone and everyone into a squealing little girl as soon as a step is taken inside.\n\n**Amy Exton’s** work is not what it loudly says on the shiniest tin. With the flashy first impression comes some intriguing aesthetic, contextual and textural associations to some prominent tinsel based practices.\n\nThe use of polished and reflective materials to surround an object or figurine to highlight its significance has been a go-to exhibiting method for hundreds of years, and has been used for religious idols standing in an alcove laden with light and shiny flecks to Elvis standing on a stage sporting rhinestone covered suits. Amy has exploited contemporary art’s attachment to exclusivity to bring integrity back to these tasteless materials and elevate them back to a status that they are and can be seen in all over the world. Coupled with this more serious note, the lasting sense of fun and entertainment is also injected into the installation, you can’t help but feel inexplicably happy when surrounded by a glitzy décor. They don’t call Las Vegas ‘America’s Playground’ for nothing.\n\nFor Amy’s website click [HERE](http://www.amyexton.com/).\n\nAlongside her artistic endeavours, Amy is also planning to launch a furniture design label **Glittergunz.** We’ll definitely be keeping our eyes peeled for that.\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16.46.04.png)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/uncategorized/22335-artist-profile-amy-exton/attachment/screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16-46-04/)\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16.45.42.png)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/uncategorized/22335-artist-profile-amy-exton/attachment/screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16-45-42/)\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16.46.43.png)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/uncategorized/22335-artist-profile-amy-exton/attachment/screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16-46-43/)\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16.46.57.png)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/uncategorized/22335-artist-profile-amy-exton/attachment/screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16-46-57/)\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16.47.26.png)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/uncategorized/22335-artist-profile-amy-exton/attachment/screen-shot-2013-06-04-at-16-47-26/)",
