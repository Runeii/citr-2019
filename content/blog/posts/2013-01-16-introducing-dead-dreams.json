  "body": "If 2012 taught us anything, it was to expect more vocal reverb and fuzzier guitars in 2013.\n\nWell the prophecy is very much baring out into reality, and for our latest discovery I couldn’t be happier. Meet Dead Dreams, a duo from France who appear to have only formed and released their first demo EP in the past week. However despite coming to the surface in a staggeringly quick succession of events, the music itself does not suffer and instead it’s a blistering combination of emphatic guitar melodies and driving percussion. I’m sure there will be a plethora of comparisons to acts of yesteryear, but there’s no point in listing them here when you can listen to the whole EP for yourself below.",
