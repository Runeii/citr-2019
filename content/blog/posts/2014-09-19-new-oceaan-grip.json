  "body": "Having begun to spread his wings on his self-titled debut EP, Manchester’s **Oceaán** changes things up on his latest offering, _Grip_.\n\nFar more indebted to house than the initial EP, it’s a choppy, bass heavy number, closer to Jacques Green or Jamie XX than the Jai Paul or Ben Khan comparisons that had been previously floated alongside his name. With his first live shows just around the corner, and the promise of more material on the way, it’s set to be an exciting end to 2014 for Oceaán. Check out Grip below, alongside European live dates.\n\n**October 1st**  Elektricity Festival, Reims, France\n\n**October 2nd**  Peniche, Lille, France\n\n**October 4th**  Marché Gare, Lyon, France\n\n**October 7th**  Laiterie, Strasbourg, France\n\n**October 18th**  Sound of Copenhagen @ DR Koncerthuset, Copenhagen, Denmark\n\n**November 1st**  Ideal Bar, Vega, Copenhagen, Denmark\n\n**November 11th**  Les InRocks Festival, Casino de Paris, Paris, France \\[w / Lykke Li and Woman’s Hour\\]",
