  "body": "Along with running the fantastic upcoming label **Hessle Audio**, and with an often hectic DJ schedule, **Pangaea** has taken the time to get in the studio and record some new sounds for our ears.\n\n2011 has seen tracks featured on two compilation albums; on ‘_116 & Rising_‘ by **Hessle** and on ‘_Back & 4th’_ by **Hotflush Recordings**, along with one release in the form of _‘Inna Daze / Won’t Hurt’_ and a smash of a **FACT** mix. Come September 12th, we see the drop of _‘Hex / Fatalist’_ on 12″ vinyl through **Untold’s Hemlock Recordings** label.\n\n_‘Hex’_ combines jungle beats, old school breaks and rolling sub-bass with a choppy, repetitive vocal sample – a track sure to get people up and moving when dropped. Second track _‘Fatalist’_ is a darker affair – a head-nodder with a liquid wobble, a snappy snare and an apt ‘LISTEN!’ vocal thrown in every now and again.\n\nBoth tracks can be heard below via the **Hemlock Soundcloud.**\n\n [HEK 013 – Pangaea](http://soundcloud.com/hemlockrecordings/sets/hek013-pangaea) by [Hemlockrecordings](http://soundcloud.com/hemlockrecordings)",
