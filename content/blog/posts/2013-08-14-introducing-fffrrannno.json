  "body": "With his most celebrated track being a remix of a certain Miss Yelich-O’Connor aka New Zealand’s **Lorde**, it wasn’t until an email this morning that I thought to check out the rest of **FFFRRANNNO’s** output, and boy am I glad I did.\n\nThe twenty two year old producer is one of the most innovative, and exciting young musicians around at this moment in time. From the choppy, percussion led rumble of _Impress Yourself_ to the multi-layered beauty of _How To Fuck Well_, **FFFRRANNNO** has no qualms when it comes to twisting vocal samples beyond recognition, and merging them with his own, pop-star ready hooks. Check out a handful of his best below, and grab a free more over at his [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/fffrrannno).",
