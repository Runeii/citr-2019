  "date": "2015-12-17T11:00:26",
  "body": "Following on from the recent release of their debut track ‘Breathing Space’ (of which you can watch the video below), South London’s Little Cub have returned with the equally impressive ‘Intent’.\n\nDelicate and deeply considered, ‘Intent’ is a wonderfully constructed piece of wistful pop music. The production wrapping the track together has beautiful moments of sonic realisation, syncing the longing romanticism of the lyrics with the strong sense of melancholy running throughout.\n\nYou can download both ‘Breathing Space’ and ‘Intent’ for free from the band’s [website](http://www.wearelittlecub.com), along with streaming them on [Apple Music](https://itun.es/gb/OFem_) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/4jMqVLtqmSgLMJMXm5vuvZ).",
