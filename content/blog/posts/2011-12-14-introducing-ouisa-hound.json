  "body": "“born of a brain pregnant with good and sober sadness” That’s a pretty captivating way to describe your own music, right? Ohio’s **Ouisa Hound** talks about his own music with such eloquence that it’s already irresistible before you’ve even heard a note of it.\n\nThese two debut tracks from the anonymous bedroom producer are “the bookends of a forthcoming album titled “The Joy Eclectic,”” and allow the brain to ponder just exactly where the rest of the record will go from here. Focusing on minimal and ambient aspirations, **Ouisa Hound** comes across as an expert story teller, despite both pieces being entirely instrumental.\n\nTake the gorgeous roll of _Well Overtaken_, as it pirouettes sumptuously through steady percussion sections and inspired samples. Other track _Gloom Roaming_ wonders the desolate soundscape it creates in such a fashion that leaves the listener craving for further transcendental experiences. Comparison wise, it’s impossible to pin down **Ouisa Hound**, there appear to be elements of **Sigur Ros** amongst the angelic sampled vocal harmonies, yet it’s grounded by a wonderful drone-based platform. With _**The Joy Ecletic**_ out next year, I’m clinging on to these two tracks in the meantime, dreaming of just how beautiful this record may well be. Hear both cuts below.\n\n [Well Overtaken](http://soundcloud.com/ouisa-hound/well-overtaken) by [Ouisa Hound](http://soundcloud.com/ouisa-hound)\n\n [Gloom Roaming](http://soundcloud.com/ouisa-hound/gloom-roaming) by [Ouisa Hound](http://soundcloud.com/ouisa-hound)",
