  "body": "As part of my desperate, futile attempt to stay relevant, I spend several hours a week trawling the diverse pages of bandcamp, looking for the internets next musical sensation.\n\nWithout meaning to sound deprecating, it’s fair to say that it’s a case of finding the diamonds in the rough. From pictures of 90’s footballers on the cross, to self described melodic doom metal, I’ve seen it all, and it’s made me a changed man. Whilst many of the gems end up on the pages of CitR, I often wonder, what happens to the (sometimes unintentional) genius of the other works? Having pondered that thought for a while, I decided to start a weekly feature, hilariously titled **This One Time At Bandcamp**, picking out some of the, how shall I put it, more unique bandcamp releases.\n\n**The Macken Mouse**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/2465830992-11-260x260.png \"Mackem Mouse\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14761-feature-this-one-time-at-bandcamp-1/attachment/2465830992-1-2/)\n\nBeing a Newcastle United fan, I had an issue with this before I’d even clicked on it. Granted, I hadn’t predicted the genius this track would contain.  \n_Asamoah Gyan is out on loan  \nSent for his tea when he couldn’t score a goal  \nNoodles and rice, cooked in his house_  \nSheer genius.\n\n**Dylan Ray**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/3127280231-1-260x260.png \"Dylan Ray\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14761-feature-this-one-time-at-bandcamp-1/attachment/3127280231-1/)\n\nTagged as ‘Justin Bieber’ and ‘Lady Gaga’, Dylan Ray is a girl/boy who sets her/his standards rather high. This white-washed photo is only matched by the brilliance of the biography, which simply states – ‘I make music that represents my life’\n\n**Tugboat**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/3607170731-1-260x260.jpg \"Tugboat\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14761-feature-this-one-time-at-bandcamp-1/attachment/3607170731-1/)\n\nHailing from ‘the slums of New York’, Tugboat looks like he has indeed just had a tug whilst listening to **Skrillex**, and that his mom, who he lives with, walked on mid session. Oh and the track features ‘The Verbal Surgeon’.  \n\n**Shana G**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/2319092656-1-260x260.jpg \"Shana G\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14761-feature-this-one-time-at-bandcamp-1/attachment/2319092656-1/)\n\nShana G has an unfortunate case of ‘blue-purple-face-syndrome.’, which effects one in five of all underproduced US rappers. Please buy her album, of which all proceeds go towards curing this ghastly disease.\n\n<a href=\"http://shanag.bandcamp.com/album/shana-g\">Shana G by Shana G</a>\n\n**B-Tite & Tha BG**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/1603533732-1-260x260.jpg \"1603533732-1\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14761-feature-this-one-time-at-bandcamp-1/attachment/1603533732-1/)\n\nThese cats have style. Check out the album artwork, courtesy of Microsoft Paint featuring Word Art. Personal favourite include DownTown 2 Tokaz Town and Catch ‘Em N Kill ‘Em.\n\n**The Blasphemists**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/1953972925-1-260x204.jpg \"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14761-feature-this-one-time-at-bandcamp-1/attachment/olympus-digital-camera-6/)\n\nI’m not too sure what’s going on here. Three naked guys standing in a river, one holding a bin, one holding a solitary cymbal and one holding a guitar, oh and one of them is smoking.\n\n**Good Looks New York**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/2836750997-1-260x260.jpg \"Good Looks New York\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14761-feature-this-one-time-at-bandcamp-1/attachment/2836750997-1/)\n\nIs it a cat? Or an eagle? But wait, it’s wearing a t-shirt? And what’s with the background? I give up.\n\n**United Guttural**\n\nI decided not to include a picture for this last one, because basically, it’s fucking disgusting. If you feel the need to check out these obscenities, you can see them [here](http://unitedguttural.net/).",
