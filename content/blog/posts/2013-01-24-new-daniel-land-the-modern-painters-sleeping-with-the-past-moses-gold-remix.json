  "body": "Mercurial Manchester-based performer **Moses Gold** has a more unorthodox approach to music than many of his contemporaries.\n\nCreation with a fluid vision in mind as opposed to simply creation for the sake of it, this remix of **Daniel Land & The Modern Painters** new single _Sleeping With The Past_ showcases just how worthwhile remixes can be, when handled in the correct manner. Completely altering the aesthetic of the track, leaving only the vocals recognisable, it’s sparse, it’s delicate and it’s painfully beautiful. Check out the remix below, as well as the original underneath that.",
