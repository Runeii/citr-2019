  "body": "2 new **[Jai Paul](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/15936-new-jai-paul-jasmine/ \"New: Jai Paul – Jasmine\")** cuts in the space of 2 weeks, Jesus, we sure are being spoiled. Details of the **Big Boi**// **Little Dragon** collaboration had been confirmed, with tracks off the record slowly making their way onto the Internet over the last few weeks, however we didn’t expect this high profile track so early. It’s hopefully in its early stages, because like _[Flip Out](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/18448-new-jai-paul-flip-out-demo/ \"New: Jai Paul – Flip Out [DEMO]\")_, it’s a tad rough around the edges. Still, it’s **Jai Paul**, hopefully I wont have to say that again.",
