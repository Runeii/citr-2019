  "body": "I refuse to believe that this is the same band that wrote Hard To Explain, The Modern Age or even Alone, Together (the worst song from **_Is This It_**).\n\nSounding like a teenage cover band trying their hand at **Ricky Martin’s** Livin’ La Vida Loca, except they’ve left all their instruments at home, bar a synth borrowed from the Spice Girls cover group and a Johnny Brook guitar belonging to the drummers dad, new track One Way Trigger is nothing short of a disaster. **Casablanca’s** struggles to hit half the notes, the production is tired and wirey, and the once energetic guitars that characterised much of their music, are lifeless and underused. If, after all of that, you’re still inclined to hear it, check it out below.",
