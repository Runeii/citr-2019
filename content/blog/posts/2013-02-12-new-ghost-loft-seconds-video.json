  "body": "Danny Choi aka Ghost Loft has recently launched the new video for his  track ‘Seconds’ The slow and sensual r&b track with a hip-hop background rhythm is enhanced by directors Daniel Iglesias Jr & Zack Sekuler ‘Ends’ which I think capture quite effectively the soothing love relationship between Choi and his distant lover.\n\nGhost Loft is an upcoming LA artist that has quickly found his spot in the music scene and continues to grow with his fascinating work. I personally love his chill-sexy vibe; so go ahead and check this amazing jam and video, you won’t be disappointed.",
