  "body": "Eighteen year old prodigy’s **Burns Twins** (Eddie and IZ) have come through under the wing of Nico Segal (formerly known as Donnie Trumpet) and Stix, and the influence definitely shows on **_Sweet ASL_**, their debut EP – a collaboration with KAINA and Bedows.\n\nSmooth and resoundingly modern, combining moments of almost freeform jazz with slicker, more pop ready songwriting, it’s a vibrant and addictively colourful release. Check out a couple of tracks below.",
