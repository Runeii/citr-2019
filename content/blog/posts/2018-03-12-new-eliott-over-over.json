  "body": "Adore the songwriting on this second single from Melbourne’s **Eliott**.\n\nThere’s a real sense of personal storytelling to _Over & Over_, seeping the track with a wistful nostalgia and romanticism. Seemingly an ode to a current partner, and the feeling of freedom and belonging found in the relationship, it manages to sound deeply intimate whilst also showcasing the sort of pop sensibilities that could open this up to a far larger audience. Check out the video for it below.",
