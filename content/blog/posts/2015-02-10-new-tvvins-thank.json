  "body": "Receiving it’s official Zane Lowe Radio 1 premiere earlier tonight, Irish outfit **All Tvvins** have been kicking up a bit of a fuss in their home country for the past year or so, but are now looking to spread their wings and take things big time.\n\nPerhaps not a game changing sound, it doesn’t really need to be in truth, and they excel at what they do – epic, riff led indie rock, just itching to be blasted out at festival main stages around the world. Check out _Thank You_ below.",
