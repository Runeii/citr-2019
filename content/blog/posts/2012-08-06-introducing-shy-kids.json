  "body": "There are fewer better sounds than organized chaos.\n\nAs the various sections of the music collide, it all suddenly begins to make sense, and the veil of obscurity drops, leaving a vivid, sparkling picture. Toronto three piece **shy kids** thrive upon this, piecing together their tracks in a manner that perhaps shouldn’t work, yet it’s the uncertainty and unpredictable nature of their three demos that make them so enthralling. Opening with the call to arms of _Raise ’em Right_, with the premiere line “_anyone can have kids, even if you’re stupid_.” proving a perfect introduction to a gripping ten minutes of music. If there’s been a more fitting line than _“now they’re teens and sayin’:  “where’s our kurt cobain?” “who do we pray to?””_ penned this year, then I’d love to hear it.\n\n**shy kids** are wonderfully and unashamedly upbeat in sound, dancing in somewhere between **Los Campesinos** and **Vampire Weekend**, however without the chart-success slickness of the former. With a handful of samples thrown in for good measure, _In The Puddin’_ is **shy kids’s** attempt at a ballad, laying their hearts out for all to ravage – _“fingers trace your nipples and the freckles on my back._ _a twinkle when you giggle, blinking to take photographs. you humbly embody body that is humbling. i-love-you’s softly said, speak volumes by just whispering. time’s an etch-a-sketch that slowly shakes your memory. the moments it erases, please don’t take this one from me.”_.\n\nThe three piece, comprised of Warwick Cedarstar, Mattheo Woodbro and Peter Hornerick appear to have been together since 2010, yet this EP titled **_Field Trips_** signals their first proper release. At the risk of sounding disastrously cliched, **shy kids** may well just be my favourite new band of 2012. You simply have to hear this.",
