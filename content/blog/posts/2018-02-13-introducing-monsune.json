  "body": "Missed this towards the tail end of last year, so really glad this cropped up on my radar last week.\n\nThis debut track from Toronto bedroom producer **Monsune** is a super ambitious, refreshing listen. Whilst heavily drawing inspiration from a host of late 80’s / early 90’s hip hop producers, _Nothing In Return_ still manages to feel resoundingly contemporary. A pop song at it’s core, I’m eagerly anticipating more music from Monsune, and could also imagine this production style being killer for other projects. Check it out below.",
