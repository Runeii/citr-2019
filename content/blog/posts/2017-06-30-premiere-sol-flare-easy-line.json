  "body": "Today Sol Flare release their debut single and we’re lucky enough to premiere it.\n\nEasy Line is a song so draped in soft synths and electro beats that, if it wasn’t for the slick production, you’d forget what year we were in.\n\nSo without further ado, dive in and fall back.\n\nAfter speaking to Jenny and Dom on [Warped Minds](https://www.mixcloud.com/solarsoundsystem/warped-minds-07-sol-flare/) last month and getting a sneak peek of their video directed by LA filmmaker Jesse Dvorak, I had to share it.\n\nSol Flare is Dominic Wood, Jenny Jones (Birds vs Planes) and Matt Marlow (The Prison Library and Waiting for Winter).\n\nPreviously supporting Dream Wife, Lisbon Kid and EKKOES, the trio have a string of shows and a full EP coming up later this year, so [keep your eyes peeled](https://www.facebook.com/Solflaremusic/) for more.\n\n_@GoldenGatsby_",
