  "body": "Artwork: Justin Camilli\n\nEight months have passed since [**Tallows**](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/artist/tallows/) first exploded onto these pages, and in the time that’s passed the Oklahoma quartet have proved themselves to be one of the finest new live acts around (a fact that I can add to weight to, having witnessed them during SXSW). With _1414_, their first new studio recorded material since the two tracks that had me so head of heels in love with them, they show off both the Vampire Weekend meets Foals pop side to the group, alongside the grittier, poetic lyricism of lead singer Josh Hogsett. _1414_, a reference to a raunchy dream involving a motel room, comes complete with one of the most insanely addictive choruses of the year, all further proof that this album is shaping up to be rather special.\n\n_this one’s gonna cost me / this one’s gonna come back and haunt me_\n\nStream 1414 below, taken from **_Memory Marrow_**, out 31 August (tracklist after the jump)\n\n1\\.
