  "body": "With only two EPs and a few singles to their name, Greek duo **Plastic Flowers** have already gathered quite a loyal internet following, and with tracks like _In You I’m Lost_ it’s not hard to tell why.\n\nRaw and unbearably honest, their imagery may tick all the boxes for stereotypical hipster buzz band, but that’s irrelevant when the music is as good as this. This clip, recorded by [senselens](facebook.com/senselens) is a beautiful home-shot rendition of new track _In You I’m Lost_, a numbing and remorseful ballad that ends far too soon. Check it out below.\n\n[Plastic Flowers – In You I’m Lost](http://vimeo.com/52699625) from [senselens](http://vimeo.com/senselens) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
