Their debut track, _White Crow_, is one of this years most beautiful and emotionally moving moments. Musically there’s elements of the heart-wrenching allure of Julien Baker, merged with the life affirming elegance of Sigur Ros or Nils Frahm, and when combined with the stunning video, makes for a truly hauntingly special first outing.",
