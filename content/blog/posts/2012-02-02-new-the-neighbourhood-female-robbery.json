  "body": "Every once in a while a near-perfect pop track comes along, and causes sizable sections of the blogosphere to self-destruct in a mess of cliches, overzealous comparisons and Twitter hashtags.\n\nThis debut track from California’s **The Neighbourhood** is set to wreak carnage amongst the aforementioned group of socially awkward, Lana-loving bloggers (myself included). With a beat that Miss Del Rey herself would be proud of, and a vocal delivery akin to everyone’s favourite sleaze-bag, **The Weeknd**, _Female Robbery_ is one hell of a debut track. Aside from one slight slip up around the 1.45 mark, it’s fairly easy to see how this gem has already been featured on **Radio 1** and **NME**. Check out _Female Robbery_ below, and grab a free download while you can.",
