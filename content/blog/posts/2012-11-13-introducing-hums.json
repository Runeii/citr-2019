  "body": "The solo outfit of Elise from Minneapolis quartet **Nice Purse**, **Hums** may well be one of the most exciting new artists of the year; and that’s an assumption based upon only three tracks.\n\nFar denser and more folk orientated than her primary band, there’s an added level of beauty to **Hums’** music, part **Sarah Jaffe**, part **Feist**, two comparisons that I don’t make lightly. Of the trio of debut tracks, _Going Places_ stands out as a future indie hit, with all the twee honesty associated with the UK female songwriters of mid-00’s (**Allen**, **Nash** etc.). As the tags suggest, it’s very much ‘pretty girl voice’, but who’s to say that can’t be brilliant? **_Deep In Swim_**, the debut LP from **Hums** is out later today.",
