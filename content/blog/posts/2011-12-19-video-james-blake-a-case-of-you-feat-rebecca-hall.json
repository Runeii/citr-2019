  "body": "It’s been a bizarre year for **James Blake**, having been named amongst the infamous **BBC Sound of**… list at the tail end of last year, his debut album fell rather flat, and failed to make the impression many had predicted it would.\n\nHis major downfall was his decision to ditch the experimental side to his music, instead focusing on the precarious vocals that he’d so finely tuned; yet the songwriting left much to be desired. Anyway, with the year drawing to a close, **Blake’s** final output is an official video for his cover of **Joni Mitchell’s** _A Case Of You_. Filmed in London last week, the clip is like a more emotive **James Blunt’s** _Goodbye My Lover_, whilst maintaining a cringeworthy element of worn down cliches. Check out the video for _A Case Of You_ below, which is taken from his recent EP **_Enough Thunder_**.",
