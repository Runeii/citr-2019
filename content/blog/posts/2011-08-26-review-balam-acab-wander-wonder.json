  "body": "It’s official, witch house is dead.\n\nThe much maligned genre has lost any sense of intrigue and is far from the phenomena that so ostentatiously swept the internet a couple of years back. Slowing down **Justin Bieber’s** voice, sampling gameboy sounds and uploading to bandcamp alongside brightly coloured artwork featuring legions of triangles no longer passes for reputable music creation. That said, it would be foolish to write off the music of all musicians who have previously been tarred with the ‘witch house’ brush.\n\nExploding onto the scene last year, the soothingly ambient sounds of New York producer **Balam Acab** were initially branded with the witch house tag, however there’s far more intelligence to the music of **Alec Koone** than your bog standard electronic experimental producer. The gloriously triumphant _See Birds_ released last year demonstrated this magnificently; being both simultaneously engaging and relaxing. Comparisons were drawn to the likes of **Pantha du Prince** and **Nosaj Thing**, as well as trip-hop outfit **Salem**, however **Balam Acab** maintains a more soulful, organic feel, not found as evidently in the works of his contemporary’s.\n\nWith his debut album **_Wander/Wonder_** released this Monday, **Koone** has a real chance to alter the perceptions of his music, and forge a name for himself. So with that in mind, it’s a bold and bizarre move to find that _See Birds_ doesn’t find it’s way onto the album tracklisting; surely a sign of belief in the quality of his own music? Introductory track _Welcome_ is a slow burner, not revealing **Koone’s** full potential, whilst constructing the atmosphere through dense rhythms and repeated samples. With a minute of the track left, it kicks ferociously into life, showcasing the real engaging side to **Balam Acab’s** music.\n\nThere are tracks that feel like entirely untrodden ground, such as the beautiful _Apart_ and the mystically effervescent _Oh, Why_; two of the records stand out moments. The elegantly composed _Apart_ with it’s pitch distorted vocals and swirling synths makes for a thoroughly enjoyable listen. It’s disappointing then, that aside from the aforementioned tracks, the rest of _**Wander / Wonder**_ doesn’t demonstrate the immense talent this young producer has.\n\n [BALAM ACAB – Oh, Why](http://soundcloud.com/tri_angle_records/balam-acab-oh-why) by [TriAngleRecords](http://soundcloud.com/tri_angle_records)\n\n_Expect_ is overly predictable, especially when set against the content of the rest of the LP. It’s the repetitive formula used on several of the tracks that lets **Wander / Wonder** down. Album closer _Fragile Hope_ appears to take influence from post-rock sources, yet the water droplet soundtrack that dominates much of the piece becomes overpowering and slightly perturbing. Where _Oh, Why_ excels through it’s melodic knowledge, _Fragile Hope_ and _Except_ fall rather flat and dour. There’s no doubting the talent of **Balam Acab**, yet for all the breathtakingly stunning moments on his debut LP, there are the times when it aimlessly drifts by, feeling less like a free-moving composition and more like an accidental collection of hurriedly recorded tracks.",
