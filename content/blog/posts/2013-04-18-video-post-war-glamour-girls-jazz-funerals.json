  "body": "This _voice_.\n\nPeople are gonna say Tom Waits, because he’s the first person they always say when it’s a voice like this. People are gonna say Isaac Brock, especially when they get their ears round the seasick chop-chop of the guitars on _Jazz Funerals_. People might say something like Matt Berninger, but I prefer Adam Turla.\n\nThere’s something about this voice, man. It’s rich and throaty, like coffee grounds down a [garbage disposal](https://www.facebook.com/postwarglamourgirls?ref=ts&fref=ts \"Aren't I clever?\"), it’s _masculine._ But it’s singing about defeat. _“Scatter my ashes by the coffee machine”_, it sings, because **Post War Glamour Girls** know that we are drowning by inches in these small luxuries. _“Hold me,”_ it sings, _“I’m weak.”_\n\nHold me. I’m weak.\n\n_Jazz Funerals_ b/w _Johnny and Mary_ is out now via [iLIKERECORDS](http://ilikerecords.limitedrun.com/products/512800-post-war-glamour-girls-jazz-funerals-johnny-and-mary-7-vinyl-pre-order \"On heavyweight vinyl.
