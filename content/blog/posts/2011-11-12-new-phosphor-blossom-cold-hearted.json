That said, who cares where a group come from when they make music as good as these two new tracks from the electro-wave duo. Heavily shoegaze influenced, _Blossom_ is a sleazy **My Bloody Valentine**\\-esque number; relentless and unforgiving in sound, but utterly fantastic. On the flip-side _Cold Hearted_ is another brooding, mysterious effort; walls of guitars block out any glimmer of optimistic light whilst the female vocals are elegant and vivaciously dominating. Check out _Blossom_ and _Cold Hearted_ below.\n\n<a href=\"http://phosphor.bandcamp.com/album/cold-hearted-ep\">Cold Hearted EP by PHOSPHOR</a>",
