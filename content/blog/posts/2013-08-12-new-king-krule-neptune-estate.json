  "title": "New: King Krule – Neptune Estate",
  "date": "2013-08-12T23:46:37",
  "body": "Here’s another cut taken from **King Krule’s** debut LP **_6 Feet Beneath The Moon_**, released 24 August through True Panther / XL Recordings.\n\nA slower, more refined number than lead single Easy Easy, _Neptune Estate_ showcases an all too realistic side to Archy that is ever prominent on his first record, mixing 60’s soul inspirations, with a grittier, almost post-punk styling. Alongside one of the most distinct deliveries of any new artist, **King Krule** also has the rare gift of being able to speak on behalf of a generation of talented, yet flawed adolescents. With the half spoken / half rapped vocals and minimalist beat, it’s sure to build excitement for the full release.\n\n_I want to be with you / I want to be used_",
