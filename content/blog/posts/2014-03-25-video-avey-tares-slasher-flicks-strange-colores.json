  "body": "We’re getting seriously excited about Avey Tare’s Slasher Flicks over at CitR. The newest project from the Animal Collective stalwart is shaping up to be a classic. His latest release from his upcoming album _Enter The Slasher House_ is ‘Strange Colores’ and, honestly, it’s awesome.\n\nThe track is reminiscent of a less frantic cut from_Centipede Hz.,_ it has a disco-esque backing track, complete with synth stabs that border on the discordant. Avey’s vocal line is in that typical Animal Collective fashion where it is both familiar and fresh, hypnotically worming itself into your head and refusing to let go.\n\nThe video, directed by Olivia Wyatt, is an explosion of kaleidoscopic psychedelia. There are jump cuts between close-up shots of lights and the band playing, creating a restless atmosphere that reflects the shuffling intensity of ‘Strange Colores’.\n\n_Enter The Slasher House _is out on 8th April on Domino Records and the video is above.",
