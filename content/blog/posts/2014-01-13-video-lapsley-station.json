  "body": "Seventeen year old** Låpsley** (Holly Lapsley Fletcher) has been everywhere over the past couple of weeks, since she dropped her newest track, _Station_.\n\nNow with a video to accompany it, the Liverpudlian teenager is all set for world (blog) domination. Pitch-shifting her own vocals to astonishing effect, landing the track somewhere between Florida wunderkid XXYYXX and Nosaj Thing, this is a very confident few first steps for a mightily exciting new musician. Station reminds me of the first time I heard those initial James Blake EPs, in that **Låpsley **is pushing boundaries perhaps without even realising it.",
