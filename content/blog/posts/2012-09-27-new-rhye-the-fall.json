  "body": "Illusive LA based duo **Rhye** caused quite a stir earlier in the year with their debut track _[Open](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14856-new-rhye-open/)_, an R’n’B ballad with more than a touch of 60’s soul about it. Having now signed to Polydor for their debut EP, entitled **_The Fall_**, out 9 October, the title track from said release premiered on [Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14330-the-fall/) this afternoon. More upbeat than Open, The Fall is unashamedly pop, and as slick as a Lana Del Rey H&M advert, with every vocal twist and violin line carefully considered, ensuring no details go amiss. Check out _The Fall_ below.",
