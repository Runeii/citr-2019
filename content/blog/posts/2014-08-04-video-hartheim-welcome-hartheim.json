  "body": "[Hartheim – Welcome To Hartheim](http://vimeo.com/101351987) from [Hartheim](http://vimeo.com/hartheim) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com).\n\nI first wrote about **Hartheim**, the Manchester based foreboding rock outfit a few weeks back and was intrigued by their angst filled musical world. They have now released visuals to accompany their brutally vulnerable  single _Welcome To Hartheim. _The video features the juxtaposition of beautiful and elegant choreography against the ominous aesthetic portrayed by the track. It’s a dark and disturbing affair, but one that is wholly captivating and enthralling. I said it before and I’ll say it again; What a bloody powerful outro.\n\nCheck out the Jack Bottomley directed visuals above.",
