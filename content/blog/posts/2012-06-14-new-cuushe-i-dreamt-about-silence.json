A gorgeously enticing synth number from Japanese singer **Cuushe** titled I Dream About Silence marks her first new material in well over three years. Taken from _**girl / you know that I am here / but the dream**_ EP, it’s a track that snuggles in somewhere betwen Bjork and Sigur Ros, with it’s ethereal nature and complexity of harmony. Check out _I Dreamt About Silence_ below.",
