  "body": "Yet another example of the thriving electronic scene in Australia at the moment, **ATHALIA’s** debut track _Blackrainbows_ is a fascinating blend of trip-hop and sugary sweet pop.\n\nWith the offbeat vocals and sampled rap segments, it’s bizarre that it works, yet it’s a wonderfully enchanting listen, requiring numerous plays to fully understand each and every layer of the track. With a debut EP _**ThoughtCrime**_ out in May, **ATHALIA** has just become one of my favourite new artists of the year.\n\n<a href=\"http://athalia.bandcamp.com/album/thoughtcrime-ep\">THOUGHTCRIME EP by ATHALIA</a>",
