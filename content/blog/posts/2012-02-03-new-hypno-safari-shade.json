  "body": "Few people have enjoyed a past twelve months as productive and as exhilarating as **Logan Hyde**.\n\nTour guitarist with close-friend **Trevor Powers** aka Boise sensation **Youth Lagoon**, who’ve just been announced as one of the support acts for **Death Cab For Cutie’s** extensive US tour, as well as being tweeted by Jessica Alba, it’s been a year that has surpassed any of their expectations. Now **Hyde** has re-worked a track from his solo-project **Hypno Safari**, to wondrous effect, and whilst I don’t normally [repost](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/8986-new-mpfree-hypno-safari-shade/) tracks, however **Shad**e needs to be heard.\n\nWith a riff as addictive as the likes of **Youth Lagoon’s** _Montana_, yet with a grittier element thrown into them mix for good measure, **Hypno Safari** embodies the sort of honesty and integrity that we’ve come to expect from Boise musicians. Check out _Shade_ below.",
