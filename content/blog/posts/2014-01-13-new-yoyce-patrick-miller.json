  "body": "Little is known about **YOYCE** aside from that: A) they hail from Perth, Australia.\n\nB) we’re probably talking about a duo and C) they make some of the freshest dance pop tunes out there. **Patrick Miller** sounds like a breath of fresh air with its tropical disco grooves landing somewhere between **Cut Copy** and **Holy Ghost**, holding tight a ’90s house vibe full of sparkling vintage synths and an air of beach flavoured pop. YOYCE nail irresistible summer washed tones, just crying out for the hot months to be upon us. Trust me, it would be a sin not to press play and enjoy this little diamond right now.\n\n**YOYCE**‘s **Exclusive Preview One** two track EP is available now for free download [over here](http://yoyce.bandcamp.com/).\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/128983042″ params=”color=ff6600&auto\\_play=false&show\\_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]",
