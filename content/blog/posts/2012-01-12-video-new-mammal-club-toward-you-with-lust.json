  "body": "This new recording & video from Mammal Club is a more laidback number than earlier tracks from the band.\n\nThe song entitled ‘Toward You With Lust’ starts with that characteristic keyboard whilst the repetition of the reverbed lyrics makes the whole thing seem a little surreal, especially with the vintage video of a school sports day.\n\nFounded by ex members of Yourcodenameis:milo and The Eyejab, Mammal Club is a three piece alternative rock band from Newcastle. The band’s debut, The Au EP, was released on the 2nd of May last year.\n\nCheck out an exclusive mix Mammal Club put together for Crack in the Road by clicking [here](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/5238-crack-in-the-road-exclusive-mix-2-mammal-club/ \"Mix Mammal Club\").  \nOr you can read Ben’s [interview with Mammal Club](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/3048-interview-mammal-club/) from way back in 2010.",
