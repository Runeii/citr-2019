  "body": "Upbeat catchy indie-pop can’t be beaten at times, and that’s exactly what **Cowboy** are all about.\n\nWith the jangly guitar lines of Foals infused with the epic stadium-rock feel of **Wild Beasts**, the Leamington Spa four piece might not be breaking any boundaries with their two debut tracks _Hacienda_ and _In Time_, but at the risk of sounding like a mainstream music journalist, they’re bloody good tunes. With a slot at [Summer Sundae Festival](http://www.summersundae.com/) on the horizon, as well as local gigs, it’s surely only a matter of time before they’re gracing the pages of other webzines. Check out both tracks below, and keep up with **Cowboy** via their [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/Cowboyband).",
