  "body": "As the winter months creep in, the annual dreary weather induced depression is almost upon us, so how about a 60’s tinged pop number to brighten up your day? **Blue Boats**, the moniker of Olly Gale, has dropped this melancholic new gem, featured on the [One For The People](http://1forthepeople.bandcamp.com/) compilation album, alongside a host of other great acts. _I Am The Only_ is lovelorn and slightly lost, yet layered with the optimism that comes with looking to the future. Check it out below, and grab a free download while you can.",
