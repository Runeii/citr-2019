  "date": "2012-07-23T17:36:59",
  "body": "The latest in the fantastic Adult Swim Singles Program comes from Californian producer **Flying Lotus** featuring verses from **Earl Sweatshirt** and the elusive **Captain Murphy** (rumored to be **Aesop Rock**).\n\nAs genre bending as ever, **FlyLo** stamps his authority all over the track, with **Earl** showing **Tyler** and the rest of **Odd Future** what it’s like to spit over a cleverly constructed beat once in a while. Check out _Between Friends_ over at this [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/wmstrecs/flying-lotus-between-friends/s-rMCoh).",
