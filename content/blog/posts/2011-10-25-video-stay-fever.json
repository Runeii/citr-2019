  "body": "Manchester’s enigmatic but elusive outfit **Stay +** (formerly **Christian AIDS**) have just dropped the video for their upcoming single, Fever.\n\nFollowing the route of previous works, the short is meticulously synced with the music, and intricately intelligent, using visuals to their full effect.  The clip tracks the progress of a hazy, drug-fueled night out in Manchester, but played out in reverse order. From putting make-up on and downing a bottle of vodka, to lucid moments in a packed club, _Fever_ is a thought-provoking look at the stereotypical adolescent lifestyle. Yet for all it’s cliches and intentional controversy (numerous scenes of drug use), it leaves the viewer with a sense of ambiguity and cautious intrigue, as it closes with the girl holding a letter that simply states ‘Follow Your Dream’. _Fever_ is released through **RAMP Recordings** on 7/11/11, check out the video below.",
