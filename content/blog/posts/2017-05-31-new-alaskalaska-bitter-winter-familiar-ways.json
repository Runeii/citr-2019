  "body": "South London’s quirky ALASKALASKA are known for their unique take on art-pop, their latest single _Bitter Winter_ thankfully plays within their similarly loose boundaries.\n\nMixing everything from fun cutesy vocals and bouncy drum machines to more dry horns, guitars and percussion Bitter Winter balances the cacophony with ease. Most bands might struggle containing the off kilter  rhythms and different sonic textures that make the track what it is. The production and synth work also give the song an incredible dynamism that really help pay off the occasional calm before the storm vibe in a big way. Have a listen to the bands superb single below.",
