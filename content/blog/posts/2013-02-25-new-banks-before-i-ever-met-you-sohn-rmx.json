  "body": "Hot on the back of **SOHN**‘s rather beautiful remix of the **Laura Mvula** track, _Green Garden_, Vienna//London based producer/songwriter has now set his sights on the much hyped artists **BANKS**.\n\nMuch like the former track, _Before I Ever Met You_ is a slow burner that slowly morphs into something pulsating and sinisterly aggravated. Hopefully this influx of remixes means we’ll be treated to some original material soon.",
