  "body": "Hailing from Frankfurt, **Jogging House** released  ‘**Relations**‘ this week after releasing his debut EP towards the end of last year.\n\nWith the first EP having gone under my radar, I’m more than happy to make up lost time after having ‘**Relations**‘ brought to my attention, as **Jogging House** has crafted a fine blend of electronics and infectiously rhythmic beats that is a delight to the ear.\n\nDescribing his sound as ‘**synthesizers and samples drowned in reverb and delay**‘ with a spice of ‘**80’s nostalgia**‘, **Jogging House** has pretty much hit the nail on the head. Moving between a range of tempos with a endearingly calm grace, the EP holds influences of RnB, while infusing this with an air of melancholy. Make sure to check out ‘**Why?**‘ in particular.",
