  "body": "**Weslee** are clearly no strangers to the music industry hype train – their debut release, _Gassed_, ticks all the boxes.\n\nAnonymous figures behind the project, super slick production and an early co-sign from Mistajam, it’d be easy to write it all off as style over substance, if the track in question wasn’t so damn good. Gassed is a silky, R&B number that hints at more chart ready offerings could well be on there way. Check it out below.",
