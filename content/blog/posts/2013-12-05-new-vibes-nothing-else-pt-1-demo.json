  "date": "2013-12-05T01:27:30",
  "body": "Having previously recorded under the moniker **Margiela Madman** (by previously, I mean earlier this year), nineteen year old Australian has re-invented, revamped, and returned as a duo with new demo _Nothing Else Pt._\n\n_1_. Unashamedly drawing from Jai Paul, most notably in the beat, there’s no doubting the potential here, particularly when the dual vocal sections come in. Perhaps more simplistic than compositions by the likes of Ben Khan or Sampha, and lacking the high budget production values that would take it to the next level, it’s still an extremely positive first step forward. Check out _Nothing Else Pt 1_ below.",
