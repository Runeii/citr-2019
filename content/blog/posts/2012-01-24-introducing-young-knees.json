  "body": "Having just written about the raw, underproduced sounds of [**Lips & Teeth**](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14386-introducing-lips-teeth/), I stumbled across another artist who chooses to keep production on his tracks to a bare minimum. Delaware based musician **Luke Nigro** aka [**Young Knees**](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Young-Knees/225223584229972?sk=info) has an appealing honesty in his songs that’s so rarely found, despite the slightly shoddy recording quality. With two tracks both clocking in at over six minutes, it’s an ambitious debut, made even more spectacular by opening the premier track _Sink_ with a single, elegantly held note. Whilst on the B-side, _Function_ is a minimalist, instrumental number, almost bluesy in parts and melancholic in tone.\n\nFrom these debut couple of tracks, it’s clear that **Young Knees** could perhaps do with slicker production, but there’s no doubting the songwriting ability and majestic air conjured up throughout. Check out both tracks below.",
