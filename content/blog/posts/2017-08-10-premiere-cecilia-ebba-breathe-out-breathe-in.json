  "title": "Premiere: Cecilia Ebba – Breathe Out Breathe In",
  "date": "2017-08-10T11:15:33",
  "body": "With her exquisite debut single, _Sweet Summer Wine_, released earlier this year, **Cecilia Ebba** is now releasing an elegant follow up in the form of _Breathe Out Breathe In._\n\nHailing from North Sweden and now living in London, there’s undoubtedly an edge of Scandinavian beauty and allure to Ebba’s intricate songwriting. Whilst Breathe Out Breathe In pulls elements from Marika Hackman’s sombre debut album, alongside the more heart-wrenching moments of Fionn Regan and Laura Marling, it manages to feel assuredly unique and act as a bold statement at such an early stage of her career.\n\nBreathe Out Breathe In is released on all major music platforms on 11 August. Check it out below.",
