  "body": "I was first introduced to **Ramona Lisa**, the solo project of **Chairlift’s** Caroline Polachek, a month or so ago via her off kilter electro ballad [_Backwards and Upwards_](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/27286-new-ramona-lisa-backwards-upwards/).\n\n_Dominic_, her most recent effort is a lot less whacky than the aforementioned track, but no less captivating. The synth backing lilts and chirps as Polacheck delivers a mesmerizing vocal performance while casually rowing around the Everglades, surrounded by alligators.\n\nWatch the visuals for _Dominic_ above and catch her debut album _Arcadia_ released 29/4 via Terrible Records.",
