  "body": "Nashville ten piece (yes, you heard that right, TEN) **Mind Not The Timid** continue their stake to the throne of epic, Arcade Fire brand indie with their newest track _The White Oak_.\n\nTaken from their forthcoming album _**Beacons**_, it’s a wonderfully expansive violin led number, that’s equally as likely to cause a singalong as it is to simply stop people in their tracks in absolute awe. _**Beacons**_ is rapidly becoming one of my most hotly anticipated releases of the year. Check out _The White Oak_ below.",
