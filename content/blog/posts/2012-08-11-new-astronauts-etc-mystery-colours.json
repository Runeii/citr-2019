  "body": "So the chillwave bandwagon may well have lost a couple of wheels along the way, yet that hasn’t stopped numerous musicians extracting the parts of the sound worth saving, and manipulating it into their own brand of electronic pop.\n\n**Anthony Ferraro**, aka **Astronauts, etc.** from Berkeley, CA has done just that, with debut single _Mystery Colours_ showcasing his own strain of “supermelodic pulp”. Silky synths and simple yet effective lyrics (“_your history, is coming back to educate me, to put me out of place and take me, to another time_“) make up the majority of what is a mightily impressive first outing.",
