It seems that **Gonja** is on a roll, with his next body of work due to be released in **Warp** on January 23.\n\nThe first cut from the mini album is a haunting, soothing yet remarkably brittle assault on the senses. When describing his work, it’s admittedly easy to contradict, at least on the surface. Yet perhaps this reveals a beauty within the work?\n\nSteam the new track below and input your email to download.",
