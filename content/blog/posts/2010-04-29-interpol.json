Yesterday they made the first song _Lights_ available to download for free from their official website, and whilst they are not covering any new ground or reinventing themselves, it is a welcome return from the New York band. A slow burning opening gives way to an **Interpol** sound much coveted on 2007’s **Our Love To Admire,** although finds **Paul Banks** in a darker, more isolated place, as he atones _“don’t turn away, and lead me to plead in this hole of a place”._ You can download _Lights_ in exchange for your email address from the link below, let us know what you think of it.\n\n[Download From Official Site](http://www.interpolnyc.com/lights.html)",
