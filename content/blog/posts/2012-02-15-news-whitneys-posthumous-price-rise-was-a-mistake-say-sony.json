  "body": "Sony has apologised for [increasing the price of Whitney Houston’s ‘Ultimate Collection’ LP just hours after the singers death](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14945-news-sony-raised-price-of-houston-album-hours-after-her-death/ \"Sony profit from Houston's death\"). The increased price that appeared on iTunes has been called a ‘mistake’ by a company spokesman.\n\nAs [previously reported](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14945-news-sony-raised-price-of-houston-album-hours-after-her-death/ \"Sony raise price of Whitney's album\") the price of the album went up from £4.99 to £7.99. The increase was spotted by angry twitter users & it quickly emerged Sony, who own the rights to Houston’s back catalogue, were responsible for the price hike.\n\nIn a statement released today (15th February) Sony said “Whitney Houston product was mistakenly mispriced on the UK iTunes store on Sunday. When discovered, the mistake was immediately corrected. We apologise for any offence caused.”\n\n[The New York Times](http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/14/sony-says-price-of-2-whitney-houston-albums-was-raised-by-mistake/) reports that a British Sony employee was responsible for the mistake and no official order to hike the price was given by the company.\n\n[The Official Charts Company](http://www.theofficialcharts.com/) have stated they expect sales of Whitney Houston’s discography to increase dramatically over the following months. [Digital Spy](http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a365662/whitney-houston-set-to-dominate-uk-singles-albums-charts.html) reports that Whitney’s albums are likely to top the album charts and 27 of the star’s songs are likely to chart in this Sunday’s UK’s Top singles list.\n\nCheck out this video of Whitney Houston performing Count On Me Featuring CeCe Winans via [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXttyNf8zv0&feature=player_embedded)",
