That’s 52,944 hours or 3,176,640 minutes, the equivalent of 190,598,400 seconds, and yesterday he announced his return with 227 seconds of stereotypical Vek danceable pop music. A Chore premiered on Zane Lowe’s show last night, and isn’t a deviation from what we’re used to from Vek. Perfectly crafted pop melodies, insightful lyrics and an all round enjoyable track, yet whether it will stand the test of time as well as We Have Sound remains to be seen.",
