  "body": "A single **Berninger**\\-esque baritone and an overpowering sense of shame, disillusionment and lust make up the majority of _Annie_, this new track from Toronto’s mysteriously titled **Prom**.\n\nSo the production leaves a little to be desired at times, but the songwriting intent and talent is clearly there, as is the lyrical efficiency; with each and every line pronounced with a meaning that could only be born from experience. Tagged as ‘drunken nights’ and ‘unnecessary fights’, _Annie_ is the girl you could never let go of, yet who held your heart through it all… and this song is for her.\n\n<a href=\"http://cryingatprom.bandcamp.com/track/annie\">Annie by Prom</a>",
