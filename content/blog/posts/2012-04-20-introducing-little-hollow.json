  "body": "With a mere one hundred and seventy nine seconds of music to the projects name, you may be asking why North Carolina based bedroom producer **Little Hollow** deserves an ‘Introducing’ article at such an early point in his career.\n\nGranted, it’s very little to cast judgement upon, but the two tracks in question; _Customer Service_ and _Get Out_ are mightily exciting. Having dipped a toe in the water under his premiere moniker (and real name) **Logan Pate**, **Little Hollow** appears to be a more considered musical affair.\n\nSlick, soulful vocals and a **Youth Lagoon**\\-esque level of emotional integrity make up the majority of the two tracks, leaving the listener unsure as to the musical direction of **Little Hollow**. Where previous work has seen **[Pate](http://loganpate.bandcamp.com/)** construct delicate acoustic numbers that often spill over the five minute mark, it’s clear he’s aiming for a more refined aesthetic with this new project. Check out both tracks below and keep up with **Little Hollow** via his [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Little-Hollow/148992445138953) page.",
