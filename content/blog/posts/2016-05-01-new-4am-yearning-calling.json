  "body": "London duo **4am** are keeping their cards close to their chests with regards to information.\n\nWith two immaculately produced tracks to their name, the debut, More. and recent offering, _Yearning & Calling_, in stereotypical blog fashion, that’s about as much as they’re giving away. Some sultry vocals, vaguely ominous sounding synths and James Blake-esque beats dominate Yearning & Calling, making for an intoxicating listen.
