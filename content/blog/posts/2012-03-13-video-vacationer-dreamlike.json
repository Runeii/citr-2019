  "body": "**Vacationer** first appeared on our pages almost a year back, with the wonderfully summery [Trip](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/6978-new-video-vacationer-trip/), a track that marked them out as having fantastic potential. Now they’re readying the release of their debut EP _**Gone**_, with new track _Dreamlike_ taken from the forthcoming outing. Again, it’s a similarly upbeat anthemic indie-pop track, echoing **Vampire Weekend** amongst the tribal rhythms and vibrant vocals. Check out _Dreamlike_ below.",
