  "date": "2014-07-28T15:44:37",
  "body": "We’re very stoked to have the premiere on Leeds based producer Favela’s chill take on Lana Del Rey’s ‘West Coast’.\n\nHaving first come to prominence last year with the sublime track ‘Easy Yoke’, which will now also be available on Majestic Casual’s upcoming compilation, Favela returns with a remix that demonstrates a subtle yet powerful level of production. Immersing ‘West Coast’ in a further level of melancholy, Favela’s take has only made us more excited for his own future releases.",
