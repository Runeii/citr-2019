The track’s an obvious departure from 2010’s six-string-centric (and fecking badass) **_Robin Hood Waiter Champion_**, but Hayes has never been one to toe the line, and what the rest of the record’s going to be like is just freakin’ killing me.\n\n[Put your hands together for the positive recluse.](http://shoesandsocksoff.tumblr.com/ \"Get your rocks off, honey\")",
