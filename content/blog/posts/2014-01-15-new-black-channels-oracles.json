  "body": "There’s something charming and essential in the claustrophobic pop tunes that London duo **Black Channels** record inside their magic little box.\n\n**Oracles** is a little dream pop masterpiece, haunting and ethereal with its ghostly electronics happily welcoming a psychedelic pop flare and a minimal, unique synth line. It’s like **Broadcast** meets **Ela Orleans**, living in hope that this two piece can help fill the empty space that **Trish Keenan**‘s tragic death left.\n\nYou can purchase **Oracles** single over at their [bandcamp page](http://blackchannels.bandcamp.com/album/oracles).\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/129020242″ params=”color=ff6600&auto\\_play=false&show\\_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]",
