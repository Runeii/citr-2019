  "date": "2013-06-13T20:07:00",
  "body": "Le Diamentaire is a member of the French Hip Hop collective DansLaCuisine, which, unfortunately is about all I know about him.\n\nIt’s not that he’s a mysterious and shadowy figure, more the fact that I can’t speak any French.\n\nYou could argue that this would hinder my enjoyment of ‘Fosse Commune’, but, whatever they’re saying, it sounds splendid. Organ stabs judder and hang, while the bass rolls underneath, lending the track an almost fairground vibe.\n\nBest of all, the track is completely free to download! God bless the internet. You can listen and grab it below.",
