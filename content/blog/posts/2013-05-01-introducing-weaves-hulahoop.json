  "body": "That’s **Weaves**, not to be confused with **Wavves**.\n\nAlthough embodying a similar lethargic drawl, this Toronto duo comprised of Jasmyn Burke and Morgan Waters have more in common with **Unknown Mortal Orchestra** than Nathan Williams. Their debut track _Hulahoop_ is three minutes of squealing guitars and off-beat vocals, combined with a pinch of Animal Collective’s _**Sung Tongs**_, to form one of the most ambitious and engaging tracks of the year thus far.",
