  "body": "Premiered via our pals at [Gorilla vs Bear](http://www.gorillavsbear.net/2012/02/13/premiere-new-selebrities-night-heat/), **Selebrities** new single _Night Heat_ is a brooding, **Cocteau Twins** inspired number, proving wonderfully psychotic in parts. Sounding like it should be soundtracking a remake of an 80’s classic film, it’s dark and menacing in equal measures, yet tinged with a gloriously enticing pop edge. _Night Heat_ is released 20 March via last years label sensation [**Cascine**](http://cascine.us/). Check out the track below, as well as a video produced by the bands very own **Jer Robert**.\n\n[Selebrities – Night Heat](http://vimeo.com/35697462) from [Selebrities](http://vimeo.com/user6781071) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
