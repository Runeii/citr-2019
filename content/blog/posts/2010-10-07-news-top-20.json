  "body": "Dear Crack In The Road Readers,\n\nFor the past month or so we’ve had a presence on the media and blog search engine **Wikio**, with an aim to promote our articles to readers that may not have otherwise stumbled across them.\n\nIn our first month we were ranked **109th** in the Music category, which we were all chuffed about as the site itself indexes just under a quarter of a million sites and blogs. However I’ve just been informed by the good people at **Wikio** that we have climbed **89 places** to **20th**! This is a fantastic achievement and one of the largest leaps seen by the staff behind **Wikio**. Now while we are unashamedly over the moon about this, I wanted to take the time to thank you all, our valuable readers, for taking the time to read our thoughts and opinions on music and beyond. I also want to thank all of those people who deem our articles worthy to link to, promote or mention in their own spheres of influence, as it is this activity in particular that pushes us up the rankings. Without your support and continuing readership this site would simply be our ramblings lost in the vast space of the interweb. Therefore, even if only to humour us and feed our starving egos, I encourage you to continue your support for **Crack In The Road** and to help us achieve that coveted **Number 1 Spot.**\n\nHere is the official **Top 20** list from **Wikio**:\n\n1\n\n[Musicrooms.net](http://www.musicrooms.net/)\n\n2\n\n[SoulCulture.co.uk](http://www.soulculture.co.uk)\n\n3\n\n[No Rock And Roll Fun](http://www.xrrf.blogspot.com)\n\n4\n\n[Popjustice](http://www.popjustice.com)\n\n5\n\n[LondonJazz](http://londonjazz.blogspot.com/)\n\n6\n\n[Tom Service on classical music](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/tomserviceblog)\n\n7\n\n[Discopop Directory](http://www.discopop.co.uk/blog)\n\n8\n\n[RouteNote Blog](http://routenote.com/blog)\n\n9\n\n[PUT ME ON IT](http://putmeonit.blogspot.com/)\n\n10\n\n[I’ll think of something later](http://davidnice.blogspot.com/)\n\n11\n\n[Girl-with-a-music-tracked-mind](http://girl-with-a-music-tracked-mind.blogspot.com/)\n\n12\n\n[Lil Wayne HQ](http://www.lilwaynehq.com)\n\n13\n\n[GoldieLocks’ Shit Yo](http://goldielocksmusic.blogspot.com/)\n\n14\n\n[20jazzfunkgreats](http://www.20jazzfunkgreats.co.uk/wordpress)\n\n15\n\n[BBC – Introducing blog](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/introducing/)\n\n16\n\n[Certified Banger](http://www.certifiedbanger.co.uk)\n\n17\n\n[Southern Hospitality](http://www.southernhospitality.co.uk/blog)\n\n18\n\n[Live4ever – The Brit Rock Daily](http://www.live4ever.uk.com/)\n\n19\n\n[Alter The Press!](http://www.alterthepress.com/)\n\n20\n\n[Crack In The Road](http://admin.crackintheroad.com)\n\n_[Ranking made by Wikio](http://www.wikio.co.uk \"Ranking made by Wikio\")_",
