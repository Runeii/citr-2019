Brisbane duo **Autumn** (Jay Kane & Tom Hobbs) are just the latest in a long list of mightily exciting acts to emerge from Oceania, and they won’t be the last. Their debut track, _Ghost_ is four and a half minutes of London Grammar meets Purity Ring exquisiteness, magnificently poised and elegant. It’s unearthing tracks like this that keep my passion for CitR alive.\n\n[![1965601_491323137639727_1931823207_o](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1965601_491323137639727_1931823207_o.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1965601_491323137639727_1931823207_o.jpg)",
