  "body": "This is absolutely gorgeous.\n\n**CSAAR** (Southampton’s Caroly Saar) has a collection of tracks on her Soundcloud, mainly instrumental demos or remixes, but this newest track, _Hidden Love_, is far and away her strongest release so far. Minimal and atmospheric, with the sort of manipulation of silence that Grouper relies upon mixed with the melodic knowledge of Grimes, it’s an intriguing and addictive listen.",
