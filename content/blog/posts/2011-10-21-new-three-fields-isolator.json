Currently I’m in a diazepam induced daze, it’s 4am and despite the mass amounts of painkiller I’m on to combat the trapped tendon in my neck, I can’t fucking sleep.\n\nSo thank god for **[Three Fields](http://soundcloud.com/threefields)**, a Birmingham based ambient producer that manages to find a way of making all problems disappear through the subtlest of techniques.  The track is the first cut to drop after his recent release **_Wild Blue Yonder_.** It’s full of blissful open spaces, transporting but never directing to a specific location.\n\nStream the track below and check out more of his work over at his [soundcloud.](http://soundcloud.com/threefields/tracks)",
