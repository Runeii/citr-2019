  "date": "2013-05-08T14:42:18",
  "body": "It’s been around 3 months since we last heard from **Joel Compass**, the 19 year old London based RnB act whose debut cut, _Back To Me_, was just heartfelt and honest enough to turn more than a few heads when it dropped.\n\nHis new track, **Fucked Up**, takes the project in a far more sinister direction. The work is still heavily autobiographical, yet now **Compass** takes on the role of the villain, venting the details of a sleeping girl in his bed to the backdrop of his girlfriend repeatedly calling him. It’s guilt smeared, regretful, honest as fuck and ultimately catchy as hell pop music, that’s arguably far more accomplished than his first effort.\n\n**Compass**’ debut EP_ Astronaut_, due to be released via Black Butter.",
