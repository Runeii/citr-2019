  "body": "Despite being only fifteen years old (yes, 15, you read that correctly), NY rapper **Haleek Maul** has had features on **Pitchfork**, **FACT** and worked with the likes of **The-Drum** and **Supreme Cuts**; impressive, huh? Must be strange for him that he’s achieved more in a matter of months than most musicians do in their entire career, however once you hear his music you can understand why.\n\nIntelligent, aggressive and provoking, his music showcases the inner turmoil of a confused, disillusioned adolescent, and it’s never sounded better. Check out his debut EP _**Oxyconteen**_ below.",
