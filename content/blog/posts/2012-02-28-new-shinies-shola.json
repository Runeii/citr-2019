  "body": "Being an avid Newcastle fan, I was slightly disappointed when Manchester four piece **Shinies** declared that their new track, _Shola_, had nothing to do with our very own lovably blunderous number 23, a certain Mr Ameobi.\n\nFortunately, the quality of the track more than makes up for this lack of connection, and is a perfect follow up to their debut outing [_Spent Youth_](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/15254-new-shinies-spent-youth/). _Shola_ is three minutes of sexually frustrated, slick indie-pop, that’s cooler than **The Strokes** in leather jackets riding Harley’s down Beverly Boulevard.",
