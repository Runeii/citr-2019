  "body": "I’m a little hit or miss with ‘slacker’ pop.\n\nI love Mac DeMarco and Real Estate but can’t stand Foxygen or Ariel Pink, that both just go completely over my head. Thankfully, Sydney quartet **Morning TV** (Brit, Tim, Ana and Cam) are right up my street – largely due to the lead vocal which is just packed full of personality. Check out their latest offering, _Turquoise_, alongside personal favourite _Dive_.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
