  "body": "Photo: Julie Rowland\n\nManaged to catch the exquisite **Talos** at HWCH at the beginning of October and was stunned by the simultaneous intimacy and expansiveness of his sound.\n\nFlowing seamlessly from sparse, emotionally fraught moments, to epic, orchestral ready numbers, all controlled by Eoin French’s dazzling vocals, his set was undoubtedly a festival highlight. This live studio take of recent single _In Time_, filmed while out in Reykjavik for Iceland Airwaves, is poignant and heartbreakingly tender. Check it out below.\n\nIn Time is out now via Feel Good Lost ([iTunes](http://smarturl.it/TalosInTime) / [Spotify](https://goo.gl/754xL0)).",
