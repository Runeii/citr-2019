  "body": "After the online success of forthcoming A-side single [A Selfish Man](www.crackintheroad.com/music/25808-new-francis-lung-selfish-man/), **Francis Lung** has released the B-side to the 7″, out via [Atelier Ciseaux](http://www.atelierciseaux.com/releases.php?lang=en&rel=sg). Written from the perspective of someone who has survived a natural disaster, it’s more reserved yet no less beautiful than the previously heard flip-side. Overwhelming in it’s sense of remorse, guilt and even frustration, it’s just another indication of the diversity, and beauty that **Francis Lung** is able to write with.",
