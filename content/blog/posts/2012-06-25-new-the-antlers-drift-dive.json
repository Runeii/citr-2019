  "body": "Far less pop orientated than their 2011 release _**Burst Apart**_, _Drift Dive_ is the first track to be taken from **The Antlers** upcoming EP _**Undersea**_.\n\nFocusing on building atmosphere as a oppose to emotionally wrought lyricism, _Drift Dive_ feels like more of a return to the minimal approach adopted on Hospice. I’m still to be completely sold on **Peter Silberman** & co, but this new cut goes some way to cementing them as a truly great band. Check out _Drift Dive_ [here](https://soundcloud.com/antirecords/the-antlers-drift-dive/s-A8LLn), taken from **_Undersea_** out 24 July.",
