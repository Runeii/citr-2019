  "body": "Manchester’s **An Blonds** may still only have a handful of tracks to their name, but damn, are they good.\n\nWith the experience of being in previous bands before (I’ll let you work out who), their songwriting is uniquely crafted and expertly produced, with new track _Currents_ being a fitting summary of their music to date. Heavily 60’s inspired, it’s slightly melancholic indie pop at it’s realest, like a UK version of **Coma Cinema**; play it to your girlfriend and watch as she swoons.",
