  "body": "The album artwork (not above, below) for **Outside’s** debut release _**Puma Punk**_ hardly inspires confidence, yet is a true testament to the worn out cliche of never judging a book by it’s cover, or in this case, a record.\n\nA shame really, as when you hear **Outside’s** first eight tracks and realize that he’s making some of the best indie-pop around, and is deserving of artwork that’s on a similar creative level. Take the seven minute epic _Solarize_, a tune so insanely danceable yet managing to remain intriguing on an emotional level, combining the elegance of **Washed Out** with the ear for a hook possessed by the likes of **Ou Est Le Swimming Pool**.\n\nIt’s refreshing to learn that I’m not the only one who has picked up on the genius of **Outside**, with him (them?) set to open for **Unknown Mortal Orchestra** at Mohawk on Sunday. You can guarantee that whilst this might be the first you hear of **Outside**, it certainly won’t be the last.\n\nThere’s splashes of 80’s inspiration throughout **Puma Punk**, no more so than on the delightfully erotic _Honey Thief_, that might just be the sort of music **Bowie** would be producing, had he had the leisure of modern equipment. It’s fairly unrelenting as a listen, yet is all the more stimulating for it. Despite having played the full release through several times, I still feel there’s greater depth to _**Puma Punk**_ than it initially divulges, and it’ll probably be several more listens before I fully understand the depth of the record. Anyway, check out a couple of choice cuts below or grab the whole thing via his [bandcamp](http://outsidemusic.bandcamp.com/), and keep up to date with **Outside** via [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Outside/197629456932867) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/iiOutsider).",
