  "body": "With covers on her [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/desireek0ch) channel ranging from the likes of **Elliott Smith** to **Deadmau5** to **Lady GaGa**, it’s clear that Pennsylvania based singer **Desiree Koch** has a broad spectrum of influences. Whilst the demand for female singer/songwriters is stretched rather thin at the present moment in time, the debut EP from Koch showcases vast potential, both in songwriting and marketability.\n\nOpening track _Tree Room_ is part **Laura Marling**, part **Eddi Front**, with the gentle aroma of 60’s Americana wafting by. As a release, it documents juggling the turmoil of inner demons and outer complexities, most notably on the stunning _Reunion_, pleading with her lover for another chance. So the sound is far from complex, with the majority of the EP composed of a singular acoustic guitar and reverb heavy vocals, it’s intricacies are still there to hear, and all the more beautiful for it.",
