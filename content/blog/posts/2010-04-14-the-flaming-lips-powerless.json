  "body": "With the premiere of the new **Flaming Lips** video barely live for more than a few hours, the internet has already gone into overdrive analyzing and dissecting this bold new direction for the band.\n\nGone is the band’s tongue in cheek sensibility, in its place is something darker and altogether more brooding. The video very much reflects this, featuring a blindfolded girl tied to a chair and one creepy looking monkey.
