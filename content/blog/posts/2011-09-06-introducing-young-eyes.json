  "body": "The ever increasing number of artists and bands releasing ambient inspired music has led to some truly beautiful tracks, with Jamie Isaac’s **Intro/Drowning Roots** acting as a very topical example.\n\nMoreover, the current ambient spark finds a great deal of its genius in the fact that there is a great deal of creative flexibility in such a genre, and **Young Eyes** have crafted such malleability like wet clay into a fine vase.\n\nBalancing with confidence on the line between ambient and post-rock, **Young Eyes** two available tracks immediately create an enveloping atmosphere. Layered with climatic instrumentation, **Young Eyes** sound is both beautiful and engaging as each track encourages you to explore the dark recesses and bright horizons which will no doubt be stirred in your imagination.\n\nWith the first track entitled by the date it was released (ignore the erroneous bandcamp release date), hopefully the date within the title of the second track will prove to be just as successful.",
