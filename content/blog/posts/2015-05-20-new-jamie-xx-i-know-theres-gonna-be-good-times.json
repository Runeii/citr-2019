  "date": "2015-05-20T19:47:13",
  "body": "With his debut solo album out in just under two weeks, **Jamie XX** has shared another cut lifted from the release, in the form of the Young Thug and Popcaan featuring, _I Know There’s Gonna Be (Good Times)_.\n\nArguably the album highlight, it’s a side to Jamie XX that we haven’t seen before, almost feels like it could have found a place on Nelly’s  2004 album Sweat/Suit, or K’naan’s The Dusty Foot on the Road. Song of the summer? Quite possibly. Check it out below.\n\nFollow our [Spotify On Repeat playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a hand-picked selection of the current hottest tracks.",
