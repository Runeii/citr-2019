Since then, subsequent tracks haven’t received as much attention, yet in all honestly, are perhaps stronger tracks, both in songwriting and production. Their most recent offering, _Drive_, shows further development of their sound, ditching any of the Lorde comparisons that haunted their initial compositions, whilst retaining the ethereal, dream pop vibes. It’s perhaps their most complete realisation of their sound thus far.",
