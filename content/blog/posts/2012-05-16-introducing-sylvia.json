  "body": "A tinkling **Perfume Genius**\\-esque piano, a tender, sombre female vocal and a haunting sense of despair.\n\nWhilst Milan isn’t known for it’s thriving indie scene, in combining all of the aforementioned elements, **Silvia Tofani** aka **Sylvia** is going some way to changing that. On her debut EP _**Musica Da Camera**_ she’s found remorseful, guilt-ridden and wallowing in lust, all backed by intimate, sparse keyboard sections and choppy beats. The likes of opener _Found Desert_ and EP highlight _I’m Not Your Mom_ see **Sylvia** slip effortlessly into her finest ballgown, pirouetting without any inhibitions. Check out the entire EP and grab a free download if it floats your boat.",
