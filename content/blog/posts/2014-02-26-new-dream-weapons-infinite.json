  "body": "Remember the first time you listened to **Zombie Zombie**, and how all those shivering emotions flourished out of their electrifying sound? Or when you’ve first noticed the music in **John Carpenter**‘s films has a life of its own? Well, Greek producer **Dream Weapons** (you might also know him as **Fantastikoi Hxoi**, his other moniker) explores these kraut-disco charming paths with all the ’70s futuristic cymbals drawing the line to an imaginary motion picture seeped in darkness.\n\nWhat **Infinite** does so well is that it pulls you into a frenetic mind chase where you can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel and probably don’t want to either. It’s sinister vibes and howling synths will leave you breathless from the first second it hits.\n\n**Pathways EP** is out now on 12” via [**Holger Records**](http://www.kompakt.fm/releases/pathways_ep).",
