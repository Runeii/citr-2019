  "body": "Having blown away a packed out Birthdays a month or so back, Denmark’s hottest new export **Blaue Blume** have released the final track taken from the sessions that also spawned On New Years Eve and Helen.\n\nOf the two live shows they played in the UK, _Jealousy_ stood out as being a fantastic indication of the songwriting skills that the group posses, and the immaculate vocals that lead singer **Jonas Smith** toys with. Heading back to the UK later in the year ([tickets here](https://parallellines.ticketabc.com/events/blaue-b/)), as well as retreating to the studio to record several new tracks, 2014 is shaping up to be a very exciting year for Blaue Blume.",
