  "body": "Another act with seemingly no information available about them at all, there’s not too much I can tell you about Austin’s **L A D D E R S**, other than that they have awesome artwork and their debut track _LIGHTS WALKED OUT_ is a wonderfully unorthodox affair.\n\nThere’s hints of **Animal Collective** and **TV on the Radio** amongst the jumble of eccentric vocals and peculiar guitar lines, although it’s entirely unique in it’s own right. Here’s hoping they can follow up _LIGHTS WALKED OUT_ with another joyous slice of psychedelic pop.",
