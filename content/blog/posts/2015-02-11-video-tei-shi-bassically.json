  "body": "One of my favourite songs of last year, and quite rightly her biggest song to date, **Tei Shi’s** Bassically now has a fittingly powerful video to accompany it.\n\nDirected by Nicolas Pesce, much like the song itself, it’s a battle in which Tei Shi herself is a worthy victor, energetic and dramatic, it’s a further step towards world domination for the NY songstress. Check it out below.",
