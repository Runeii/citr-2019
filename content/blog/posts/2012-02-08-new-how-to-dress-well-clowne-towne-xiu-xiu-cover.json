  "title": "New: How To Dress Well – Clowne Towne (Xiu Xiu Cover)",
  "date": "2012-02-08T17:04:53",
  "body": "One of my favourite artists of the past few years, **How To Dress Well**, has donated a splendid cover of **Xiu Xiu’s** _Clowne Towne_ to blog start-up project **Ad Hoc**.\n\nHis rendition of the 2004 track is sparse and elegant, with his dreamy vocals taking the reins and removing the rougher edges found on **Xiu Xiu’s** version. With a new album expected later this year, _Clowne Towne_ marks the start of what will hopefully be a prolific year for the songwriter. Check out _Clowne Towne_ below and purchase it by donating to the **Ad Hoc** [kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ricleichtung/ad-hoc).",
