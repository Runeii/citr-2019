  "body": "NAMEDROP TIME: I went to school with London beat maestro **Slime**; weird huh? Anyway, since appearing on the scene, he’s proved that taking it slow and steady can indeed be a strategy that works, and that pummeling our ears with a new track every 64 seconds does, after a while begin to affect the quality of the music produced.\n\nThis artsy new video for the minimal _Anni_ transports the viewer to central London, taking in the sights of all the hippest places around, and shot in beautiful fashion. Why not give it a little watch below? _Anni_ is taken from **Slime’s** upcoming EP **_Increases II_** out 26 June on GETME!.",
