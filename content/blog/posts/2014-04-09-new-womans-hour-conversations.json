  "body": "With their first US trip under their belts, and a rapidly growing UK fan base, London four piece Woman’s Hour have just announced details of their debut LP, [Conversations](https://itunes.</p><p>apple.com/gb/album/conversations/id849723744?ign-mpt=uo%3D4), set to be released 14 July through Secretly Canadian. Featuring a few previously heard tracks, most notably _Her Ghost_ and a beautifully reworked version of _Darkest Place_, alongside the newly streaming title track, it’s set to be one of the most anticipated records of the year. More upbeat than other outings, it’s bold, cinematic and further indication that Woman’s Hour are all set for a fantastic year.",
