  "date": "2012-02-21T20:13:18",
  "body": "With this, their second single, Manchester dark-pop outfit **NO CEREMONY** raise the bar, with two tracks that are as twisted as they are beautiful.\n\nA-Side _HEARTBREAKER_ is a synth driven monster, conjuring up an atmosphere that is both menacing and intensely addictive. On the flip-side _BREAKHEARTS_ is a more dance orientated affair, equally tenebrous, relying upon pitch-shifted vocals to add an extra dimension to the track. Think Metronomy heard through the ears of a serial killer. Check out both tracks below, and grab a free download of _HEARTBREAKER_.",
