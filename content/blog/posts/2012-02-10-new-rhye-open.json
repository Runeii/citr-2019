  "body": "When I was sent this track earlier on today it inspired a simple statement, “This is the most beautiful thing I’ve heard all day”.\n\nA quick scan of my Facebook feed and the general consensus was simple, we have a little bit of a masterpiece on our hands.\n\nThe track is said to come from an anonymous California-based duo named **Rhye**. They’ve currently got a 12″ out on [Innovative Leisure](http://innovativeleisure.net/), featuring the above track, ‘**_Open_**’. The first thing that will hit you is the strings, recorded to a remarkable level of clarity, they’re unnervingly beautiful marvel to take in. The vocals mirror the atmosphere perfectly; they glisten with a startling level of precision, with the lovesick lyrics, “_I’m a fool for your belly__…__..the gentle sting between us”,_ falling gracefully over the listener with a soothing degree of sorrow.\n\nThings are bad right now, but at least you have this song.\n\nVia [the Fader](http://www.thefader.com/2012/02/02/rhye-open-mp3/).",
