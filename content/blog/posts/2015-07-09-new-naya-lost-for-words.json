  "body": "Easily the best part about music blogging is hearing slightly raw music with stacks of potential, as opposed to hearing the polished, ready for radio singles that nowadays seem to dominate the Hype Machine charts.\n\nThis debut from London’s **Naya** definitely oozes potential (and that’s not intending to belittle the quality here); part Shura, part HAIM, it’s a real 80’s synth-pop throwback. Check out _Lost For Words_ below.",
