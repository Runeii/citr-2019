  "body": "Devon duo **Matthew and Me** are slowly but surely building up an impressive catalogue of expertly penned, atmospherically gorgeous indie-pop songs.\n\nWith touches of Ben Howard’s sublime second album, alongside more epic, stadium leaning aspirations, this is anthemic songwriting at it’s absolute best, and undoubtedly an ambitious step forward. Their latest, _Silver_, is perhaps their strongest release to date; managing to come across as both emotionally fragile yet somehow reassuringly confident. Check out Silver below, lifted from their forthcoming Startpoint EP, released via Beatnik Creative (Palace, Island, Eliza Shaddad).",
