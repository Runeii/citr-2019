The place was charmingly full of kitsch woodwork and Eastern European waitressess. The beer overpriced but the conversation rich. Max was a friend from college who had dropped out of a degree in Biology and ended up on an English masters through the quality of his poetry and prose alone.\n\nSince then even more has changed. This week I found Max [naked on the Opium bed in Coleridge’s study](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/aug/15/naked-poets-calendar-male-muses) and last month, his first poetry pamphlet [‘Modern Love’](http://www.flippedeye.net/store/product_info.php?products_id=80) was released with Flipped Eye Publishing.\n\n**SG: Writer, model & internationally published poet, It has been a strange few years for Max Wallis. I thought we would catch up so you can tell Crack In The Road why, how & who?**\n\nMW: \\[In Biology\\] I kept on getting firsts but no satisfaction. My workload was getting crazy and I wasn’t sleeping because I was writing all day and then doing university work all night. I snapped and had a bit of a breakdown. Applied for the masters never thinking I’d actually get on … but did.  \n**  \nSG: In Modern Love and many of your earlier poems there’s a real blend of Baroque technique and 21st Century lyricism. What inspires you?**\n\nMW: Everything. My first pamphlet’s all about love so naturally relationships and everything inbetween have impacted that. It’s a bit like novel writing though, some of the best advice I got when I was younger was that it’s okay to lie in poetry – people have this prevarication that it’s about catharsis but really it’s just as much about narrative as fiction.\n\nI like the beauty in small things and how it’s possible to write about modern life in poetry. What’s the meaning of a text message? an email? facebook? is there room for poetics in them? I think there is.\n\n**SG: Poetic reccomendations?**\n\nMW: I read more than I ever used to. The bloodaxe anthologies are practically encyclopedias to me and I read [The Rialto](http://www.therialto.co.uk/pages/ \"The Rialto, Arts Council funded poetry mag\"), [Magma](http://magmapoetry.com/) & [Popshot Magazine](http://www.popshotpopshot.com/ \"Popshot, poetry & illustration magazine\") a lot. I tend to buy pamphlets rather than collections though.\n\n**SG: You tell me your first open mic didn’t go down so well?**\n\nMW HA! 2008. Awful. Utterly awful. I was a nervous wreck and had to loop my legs around the chair to hide my shakes. Then I wrote a poem about dicks and the social networking side of the gay world and, because it was so outlandish, in a way it was easy to perform. It wasn’t me speaking. It was a performer.\n\n**SG: And performing on stage now?**\n\nMW: Ah I love it. If you can make someone cry, cheer, laugh or anything in a room full of people then you know you’re doing something good. I choose the set list in advance so that there’s a flow to the material with sad ones interspersed around happier, funny poems. But on the day I can swap and change. I know them off by heart so it’s pretty easy to do. I still get nervous though, just don’t shake!\n\n**SG: Ever had a particularly bad reception?**\n\nOnce I did particularly gay material in a pub in Manchester, full of chavs and their girlfriends. I opened with a poem all about threesomes and genitalia. The lads all kinda bared their teeth but the girls laughed so it went okay. One time I did the threesome poem in front of another group and one part goes ‘and where’s the passion when all you have is this ration, this tiny slice of double-human pie, two guys plus you aside not inside’ and someone yelled ‘I BET THEY WERE.’ I just looked at him, and performed the next stanza never looking away ‘skin upon skin upon skin upon bone and yet you’re alone and watching them groan, attempting those manoeuvres a tactical chooser trying to negotiate limbs’ and he was chucked out.\n\n**SG: Theres been a lot of buzz about Modern Love but tell me in your own words, what is it all about?**\n\nMW: It’s a tale of love, naturally, over the course of one year between two characters. You take their journey: of yearning to sex to betrayal and everything that follows. But each poem is self contained and understood out of context but together they make something entirely different. I loved writing it. I had the idea for the pamphlet for around a year or so and I guess I just finally got to the position where I could writing it.\n\n**SG: With arts funding cuts & possibly more competition than ever before, how do you find the motivation to keep going, instead of throwing in the towel and getting a McJob?**\n\nMW: To be honest I’m supported a lot by friends and family. I don’t think I’d be able to do it without them. Modelling brings in cash but it’s early days. Eventually I want to earn enough from those aspects of my life so that I have the time to write and, not worry about  earning enough money from my poetry & novels.\n\nModern Love is available now, direct from the [Flipped Eye Bookstore](http://www.flippedeye.net/store/product_info.php?products_id=80 \"Max Wallis - Modern Love\") or from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Modern-Love-Flap-Pamphlet-Wallis/dp/190523337X).\n\nFor more of Max’s escapades you can [follow him on twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/boommaxboom) or find him on [Tumblr](http://maxwallismaxwallis.tumblr.com/)",
