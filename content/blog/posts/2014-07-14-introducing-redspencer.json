Vocals cut through enough to hook you in but not enough to dominate, and the hazy guitar feels as bright – but perhaps not as shimmering and luminescent – as a Wild Nothing track. **Redspencer** aren’t asking you to dance, but that’s exactly what you’ll wanna do.

The Melbourne-based lads (previously of the Gold Coast) have written one of the most charming songs I’ve heard in a long time, and the video for it only bumps that charm up another level.\n\nYou can download _Tell_ (plus some of their other tunes) for free from [their triple j Unearthed page](https://www.triplejunearthed.com/artist/redspencer \"Redspencer - triple j Unearthed\").",
