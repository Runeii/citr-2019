  "body": "Chester trio **Peaness** have probably the best name of any new band around right now.\n\nTheir debut EP released last year, a collection of frenetic three minute pop songs, marked them out as one to watch, and their latest single, Oh George, an anti-love song dedicated to Tory arsewipe George Osborne, may well be their finest offering to date. ‘All your friends are just as bad / all your faces makes me mad’ – there’s arguably not been a criticism of the Conservatives as cutting or as smile-inducing brilliant.
