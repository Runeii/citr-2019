  "body": "Strolling onto the scene with a slightly ungainly youthful charisma and a twee take on riot grrrl, **Maggie Moon** may well have just invented bubblegumpunk (bubblegunk?).\n\nArmed with quirky, upbeat choruses (_I Will Die_) and an almost sleazy ability to write sexually frustrated pop gems (_Shine_), this three track EP from the Pomona quintet is chockablock with thrills, frills and an adorable sense of friendship. ‘_You’re such a crazy loverboy_‘ screeches the female lead singer on _Boop Dap Beep Dap_, coming across like an even more lo-fi **Be Your Own Pet** or even **Metric** without the outlandish production values. Check out their debut EP _**Werewolf Thumb**_ below.",
