  "body": "After posting a new song from **Jamie Isaac** only last night, it’s with great pleasure that I bring you another cut from the teenage producer.\n\n_Can See_ is a piano driven ballad, relying heavily on the vocal capabilities of **Isaac** and his lyrical prowess. Thematically the track is mournful and melancholic, filled with longing and remorse, and sure to pull on numerous heartstrings. Check out _Can See_ below.\n\n_  \nWater draining through these open clouds. See, my tears they run around_\n\n_And I can’t see the way, no i can’t see your face._  \n_Shifting along the edge._\n\n_Shedding skin whilst sunlight beats on us. Though my tears are filled with lust._\n\n_And i can See the way, yes i can see your face._  \n_Drifting along the edge._",
