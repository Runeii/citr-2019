  "title": "New: April Towers – When The World Screamed",
  "date": "2014-01-14T14:27:32",
  "body": "It’s been almost two months since we last heard from Nottingham duo April Towers, however with the start of a new year they have returned with possibly their most complete piece of work to date.\n\n‘When The World Screamed’ takes little time in building into what is clearly a wholeheartedly anthemic track, channeling the band’s sound in a direction more aligned with dance music. With that said, there are still the trademark subtleties within ‘When The World Screamed’ that will stir immediate references of Hot Chip in the mind of the listener, along with a plethora of 80’s pop classics. What’s more, you can download the track for free below.\n\nAnother positive step forward for an exciting new act, and you can catch them live on the 21st February at Nottingham’s Jam Cafe.",
