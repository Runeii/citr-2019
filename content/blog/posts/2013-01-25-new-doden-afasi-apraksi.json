  "body": "Norway is the most beautiful country in the world.\n\nWell, certainly out of all places that I’ve been to, Norway is right up at at the top; from the rolling expanses of greenery, to the halcyon beaches, not to mention the wealth of attractive females. Norwegian outfit **Døden** encapsulate two of those traits, with their composed debut tracks _Afasi_ and _Apraksi_. Now here’s where my rather limited knowledge of drone lets me down, but there’s hints of **Aphex Twin’s** **_Selected Ambient Works Volume II _**and of course, king of drone, **Tim Hecker**. Strap your headphones on, turn it up loud, and just listen.",
