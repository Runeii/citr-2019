  "body": "For me at least, [S O H N](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/18086-new-s-o-h-n-red-lines/ \"New: S O H N – Red Lines\")‘s emergence has been one of the most exciting things to happen this half of 2012. The new video for the EP’s title track , _The Wheel_, is a calm and delicate comparison of nature and mechanisation through the use of stock footage. In a way, he misses the chance to finally play with more humanised visuals that undoubtedly would fit perfectly with the music’s grand image. But regardless, **S O H N** is finally on the map, we’re excited to see what happens.\n\n‘_The Wheel_’ came out On Monday via the [Aesop Label](http://aesoplabel.com/store/s-o-h-n/the-wheel).",
