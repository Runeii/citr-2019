  "body": "I’m not sure if I could tell you many bands from Harrogate, however if I did ever get asked the question I need now only to remember one name; Litany.\n\nComposed of Jake Nicolaides and Beth Cornell, Litany appear to have been in existence for over a year now, although their latest effort, ‘Slopes’, is a clear development in their sound. A justifiable amount of emphasis is placed on Cornell’s sublime vocals, and Nicolaides accompanying production begins in a subtle manner before building into a smooth yet energising climax.\n\nA promising early effort of this latest incarnation of their sound, and it’ a sound Litany will hopefully continue to explore.",
