According to an [interview with Avey back in 2009](http://reynoldsretro.blogspot.co.uk/2009/01/animal-collective-feels-directors-cut.html \"Avey Interview\"), when AC were sending out their first album [Spirit They’re Gone, Spirit They’ve Vanished](http://www.last.fm/music/Animal+Collective/Spirit+They%27re+Gone+Spirit+They%27ve+Vanished) they were contacted by a confused Southern Records. The label asked Avey “Is there something wrong with this? This music makes our dogs run out of the room!” There was nothing wrong with the record.\n\nTour dates below.
