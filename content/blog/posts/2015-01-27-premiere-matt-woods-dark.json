  "body": "Having an artist describe their own music can be understandably difficult.\n\nJust how do you begin to put into words the emotions that led you to pen those lyrics, or to compose those melodies… it’s nigh on impossible. That said, emerging artist **Matt Woods** manages to succinctly summarise his newest offering, _In The Dark_, as “_an intimate moment, when you feel really close to someone… about how just as soon as it happens it has gone. It’s sort of pleading with that someone to not wake you up from this brief moment._” It’s this sentiment of pleading that echoes strongest; laying emotion bare, in an manner that is relatable and conveyed excellently through his stunning vocal. A new leaf if you will, and certainly a new chapter in his musical journey, it’s quite possibly the beginning of something brilliant. Check it out below.",
