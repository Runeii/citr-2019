  "body": "If there’s one thing the blogosphere has a lot of at the moment, its interesting and experimental hip-hop.\n\nFrom the work of **[Knxwledge](http://gloof.bandcamp.com/)** to the bizarre and yet wonderful **[Gonjasufi](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/12135-new-gonjasufi-the-9th-inning-ep/ \"New: Gonjasufi – The 9th Inning EP\")**, there really is something for any and every type of weirdo. [**Pig Pen**’s](http://pigpen.bandcamp.com) new beat tape strikes an interesting balance between the odd and the archetypal.\n\nThe record jumps from 50’s horror score like strings to freaky and bubbling synths, while simultaneously having an affair with old-skool jazz, with a huge amount of conviction, yet the mesh of the more genre focused and experimental sounds never seem to feel at odds.\n\nMore than anything, the record is great to chill out too. Once the appreciation of the crate digging is over, what’s left it a spiritually enhancing set of mellow beats.\n\nStream the full tape below.",
