  "body": "I’ve only recently come across Mizan, however the discovery could not have been timed any better as I enjoy the final few hours of a relaxing Sunday evening and press play on this wonderfully chill new track entitled ‘Thru’.\n\nYou’ll be able to find a good biog on Mizan with relative ease, given the fact the likes of Clash, Earmilk, and Wonderland, have already offered kind words, so I won’t go into too much depth here. What you do need to know is that Mizan hails from New York, and this affects her music to it’s very core essence. In a world that has seen the rise of BANKS and SZA, it could very well be this authentic and close connection to her native city that separates Mizan out from the competition.",
