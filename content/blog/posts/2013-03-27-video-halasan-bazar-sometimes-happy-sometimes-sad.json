  "body": "Our friends over at **Crash Symbols** have a **Halasan Bazar** release, _Space Junk_ due out April 2.\n\nThe bitter sweet, 60’s inspired pop act are increasingly becoming a go-to of mine as we get closer to summer. The new video for ‘_Sometimes happy, sometimes sad_‘ is an appropriate if not expected visual interpretation of the track. Rapid fire textured visuals, with a surrealist escapade tale at the videos core; I can get on board.\n\nPitchfork also dropped a new track from the release yesterday, to which I’m struggling to find code. Bloody Pitchfork; [listen to it here.  \n](http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15183-you-i/)",
