  "body": "So the new tune from camp **M.**\n\n**I.A** dropped earlier today and sent the Internet into a tizz. Less of a tizz than I expected, but regardless, more than I few people got excited. Now I hate to piss on a perfectly harmless parade, but the new track, **_Come walk with me_**, hardly fills me with confidence in the upcoming album, **_Matangi_**. It all just sounds a bit awkward; the singing, the supposedly inspiring lyrics not to mention the pop sensibility that suddenly becomes disinterested and embarks on a little experimental adventure mid track.\n\n**M.I.A**; if you’re reading this, which of course you’re not, this is what I want. Weird ass instruments, provocative streams of consciousness, socially conscious yet seemingly erratic flows and if you’re feeling particularly generous, with a sprinkle of rebellious thinking.\n\nThnx xxxo",
