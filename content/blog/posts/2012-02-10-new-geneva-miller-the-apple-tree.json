  "body": "This new track from California’s **Geneva Miller** is dreamfolk personified.\n\nLanguid synths, floaty vocals and a lightly picked guitar make up the majority of _The Apple Tree_, a song that almost appears to consist of one long chorus, yet a sparklingly good one at that. The repetitive line “_leave me be, underneath the apple tree_” features numerous times throughout the track, yet is intoxicatingly addictive. Check out _The Apple Tree_ below.\n\n<a href=\"http://genevamiller.bandcamp.com/track/the-apple-tree\">The Apple Tree by Geneva Miller</a>",
