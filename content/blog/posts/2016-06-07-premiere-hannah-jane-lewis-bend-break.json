  "date": "2016-06-07T12:52:58",
  "body": "There’s something mightily refreshing about hearing a new artist approach pop music in such an unashamedly bold manner – and there’s no doubting that London’s Hannah Jane Lewis knows her way around a pop hook or two.\n\nMerging elements of Halsey and CHVRCHES, her latest track Bend or Break is scintillating synth-pop, with a sleek, contemporary sheen to it. With a debut EP out later in the summer, and her tracks so far already earning a multitude of plaudits, it’s set to be a hugely exciting few months for Hannah Jane Lewis. Check out Bend or Break below, as well as her previous single, Why Start a War.",
