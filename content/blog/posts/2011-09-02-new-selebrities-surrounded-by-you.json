  "body": "**Cascine** are one of the slickest labels around, one refer to them as **The Strokes** of the record label world, albeit with far fewer leather jackets.\n\nNew track from Brooklyn trio **Selebrities** certainly doesn’t buck the trend of **Cascine** putting out flawless releases, with the twee inspired _Surrounded By You_ proving just as lovingly adorable as the other artists on the innovative label. It’s instantaneously catchy and overwhelming addictive, harking back to the likes of **Be Your Own Pet** and **Los Campesinos** through it’s darling romanticism and unrivaled honesty. **Surrounded By You** is available as a free download below, courtesy of **Cascine**.\n\n[Surrounded by You](http://soundcloud.com/selebrities/surrounded-by-you) by [selebrities](http://soundcloud.com/selebrities)",
