One such avenue that I believe has immeasurable potential, is the power of visuals to accompany music. With the likes of **WU LYF**, **Christian AIDS** and everyone’s favourite punching bag **Lana Del Rey** embracing modern times with fantastic visual creations, there’s no doubting the extra level of emotional and intellectual integrity it adds to the music.\n\nManchester’s [**Embers**](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Embers/212719658738967) have just released a trio of videos for their three debut tracks, _Tunnel Vision_, _Days Turn Into Weeks_ and _Without Fear or Favour_, all of which are thought-provoking experiences. My choice cut, the deliriously rampant _Tunnel Vision_ is a fuzz-driven number, accompanied by sampled clips torn from various sources, showing desolation, isolation and desperation at their most extreme.
