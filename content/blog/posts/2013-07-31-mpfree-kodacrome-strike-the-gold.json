  "body": "**Kodacrome **are one of those artists that I swear I’ve heard of, but a cursory trawl of Google, Last.\n\nfm and Facebook suggests otherwise. Which is why we’re a little behind on posting up _Strike the Gold_, the first single from the band’s upcoming LP, overlooking what I thought was a completely different band to instead listen to the new **Franz Ferdinand **album that landed at the same moment (which, by the way, is so underwhelming I don’t have the patience to review it).\n\nBut anyway, _Strike the Gold_ is well suited to listening at this time in the morning, combining a gently rippling synthline, hush-hush vocals and vague, sampled snippets to create an interesting yet understated piece.\n\nIn fact, that pulsing synthline serves as the heartbeat from which the other layers falteringly grow, building in to a track that has echoes of _Sun God _by **Cut Copy.**\n\n[Download it here](http://www.bantermm.com/tracks/Kodacrome-StrikeTheGold.mp3), or watch the video below.",
