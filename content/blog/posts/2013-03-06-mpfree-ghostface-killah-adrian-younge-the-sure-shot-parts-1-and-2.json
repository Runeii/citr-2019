  "body": "Last night, [Ghostface Killah](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/artist/ghostface-killah/) dropped ‘The Sure Shot \\[Parts 1 And 2\\]’, the second track he has released from his upcoming collaboration with [Adrian Younge](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/artist/adrian-younge/), _Twelve Reasons To Die._ It definitely sounds that Ghostface is back on form, flowing over the jittery beat with confidence and those trademark offbeat rhymes.The second part of the song is stronger, as it allows some space between Ghostface’s bars, meaning he doesn’t sound quite as strained, but, whatever your opinion on what the best half ‘The Sure Shot’ is, one thing is for sure, it  warrants multiple listens.\n\n_Twelve Reasons To Die_ is a set to be a concept album that takes inspiration from crime and horror films, which, if nothing else, is an interesting proposition. RZA is the executive producer on the album while Adrian Younge is providing the beats. You can listen to and download ‘The Sure Shot \\[Parts 1 And 2\\]’ below and grab the full release on the 16th April.",
