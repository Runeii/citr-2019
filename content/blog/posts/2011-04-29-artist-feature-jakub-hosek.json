Featuring mangled and grotesque imagery, combined with vivid colours, Hošek finds himself with something that appalls as well as engages. Put simply, Hošek is a painter, but it’s the subtle influences of illustration and drawings that crawl awkwardly over the canvas, that give the work a sense of depth. Even without it, Hošek orchestrates comic-book like landscapes that, although baron and surreal, provoke a perverse, unobjectionable urge to explore.
