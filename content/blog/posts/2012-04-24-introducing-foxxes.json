  "body": "The project of an ‘eighteen year old caucasian male from amsterdam’, **Foxxes** is clearly still very much in it’s infancy.\n\nWhilst the description ‘First five tracks I’ve made under this name’ would suggest that this may not be the first outing from this young beatmaker, I highly doubt it will be his last. This debut collection of tracks released under the title _**Otocyon**_ EP just scream potential, with their ever-so-disjointed feel and slightly lethargic atmosphere.\n\nThere’s moments when **Foxxes** appears overly rigid and reliant on the same repetitive loops, yet when he choose to experiment and push the boat out further (_Ongaku_) it pays dividends. It’s modern instrumental hip-hop at it’s utmost youthful and intoxicating, conjuring up a mystical and at times enchanting vibe. Although it’s still early days, this debut EP puts **Foxxes** up there with the likes of **Beat Culture** and **xxyyxx** as a real name to watch out for in the future. Check out a couple of choice picks below and grab the full EP from his [bandcamp](http://foxxxes.bandcamp.com/).",
