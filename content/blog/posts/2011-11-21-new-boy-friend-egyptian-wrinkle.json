  "body": "This dreamy new track from **Christa Palozzo** and **Sarah Brown** aka **Boy Friend** is a fantastic slice of languid, sensual pop.\n\nWith _Egyptian Wrinkle_ set to feature on their debut LP of the same title, due February next year, it’s a more openly pop inspired tune than previous project **Sleep ∞ Over**, but isn’t too much of a departure. There’s the shoegaze influenced vocals and the deep rooted sense of longing and lust, all tied up by the seductive vocals of **Palozzolo** and **Brown’s** omnipresent echoed guitar. Check out _Egyptian Wrinkle_ below, and keep an ear out for their debut LP out next year on [Hell, Yes Records](http://www.hellyes.it/news.html).\n\n [Egyptian Wrinkle](http://soundcloud.com/christapalazzolo/egyptian-wrinkle) by [Boy Friend](http://soundcloud.com/christapalazzolo)",
