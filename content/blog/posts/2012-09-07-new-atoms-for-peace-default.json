  "body": "As a general rule, ‘supergroups’ suck, and I’ll be honest, when it came out that **Thom Yorke** (Radiohead), **Flea** (Red Hot Chili Peppers), **Nigel Godrich**, **Joey Waronker** and **Mauro Refosco** had put their creative minds together to form the pretentiously named **Atoms For Peace**, I had my skepticism’s.\n\nIn true **Yorke** style, it’s always hard to differentiate between the worthwhile musical output and what is simply a massaging of his already colossally inflated ego. Thankfully, the first recorded track from the quintet, _Default_, made available on iTunes yesterday, is all we could ever hope for, and so much more. Mixing **Yorke’s** recent obsession with choppy melodies and dub-percussion sections with the immaculate production of **Godrich**, it’s far superior to anything from **Radiohead’s** most recent LP.",
