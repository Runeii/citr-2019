  "body": "Australia on top form yet again.\n\n**Taxes**, the “one-man-band pursuit” of Flynn Wheeler has one EP to his name, the romantically/suggestively titled _**Back of the Car Collection**_, five tracks of lovelorn shoegaze inspired dream-pop. Marking out the likes of The Jesus & Mary Chain and Teenage Fanclub as influences, there’s also touches of more modern artists like The Pains of Being Pure At Heart and Wild Nothing. EP opener, _Back of the Car_ is one of the finest tracks of the year, so elegantly composed and so hopelessly in love, that it seemingly fills an almost transcendental space. As it so often happens when I stumble across something as downright fantastic as this, I’m struggling to express myself properly. Check out _Back of the Car_ and _Over The View_ below, then stream his debut EP is full below that.",
