It’s full of hope and yet tinged with lost memories and failed expectations. Rather than simply being, ‘that song for the summer’, _Sky Child_ manages to be so wide and grand in scope, it encapsulates the period as a whole. It depicts the highs and lows of a period of life, regardless of the season.\n\n_Sky Child_ is out now on [**Crash Symbols**.](http://www.facebook.com/crashsymbols)",
