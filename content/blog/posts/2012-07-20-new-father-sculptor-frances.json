  "body": "What is it with Scottish bands and writing unbelievably epic anthems? **The Twilight Sad**, **Idlewild** and **Frightened Rabbit** spring to mind immediately, and even **Snow Patrol** and **Franz Ferdinand** dig the occasional festival hit out of their lockers.\n\nGlasgow’s **Father Sculptor** appear to be continuing in that very vein, with this despairingly open new track _Frances_, launching straight into the shoegaze inspired riffs and bellowing vocals from the word go. Coming it at over five minutes, _Frances_ is a musical explosion, and boy is it beautiful.",
