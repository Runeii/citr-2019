Adopting an arguably more serious tone when compared to last year’s bulk of work, ‘Swate’ sees them collaborate with Mike Finto and Lakutis to remarkable effect. Full of swarming Bollywood samples, a thick groove and the stomach churning political observations we all know and love; 2011 could well be the year of Das Racist.\n\n[Download](http://cdn.stereogum.com/downloader/?file=%2Ffiles%2Fmp3%2FDas+Racist+-+Swate/)  \n [Das Racist – Swate](http://soundcloud.com/hypetrak/das-racist-swate) by [Hypetrak](http://soundcloud.com/hypetrak)",
