  "body": "Artwork by **[monoloquia](http://www.flickr.com/people/monoloquia/)**\n\nAnother few days go by and I find myself, yet again, writing about a **[Housewarming Records](http://housewarmingrecords.bandcamp.com/)** artist. This time it’s the turn of London based 3-piece [**Arks**.](http://arksmusicuk.bandcamp.com/) They‘re actually a brand new inclusion to the Housewarming roster, with their new EP, ‘**_–_**’, debuting on the New York based label.\n\nIn many ways it’s the bands duality in sound that makes them so interesting to listen to. The vocals are clouded and hazy, while the guitar riffs sour and grace the skies, both in elation and melancholy. It’s this boyish melancholy combined with zoned in guitar sounds, that makes this 4 song EP so very charming.\n\nStream and download the record below.",
