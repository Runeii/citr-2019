  "body": "I know for a fact that London four piece **BUIL\\_DINGS** have already begun gathering a decent stream of hype, however to be honest, I’m somewhat undecided.\n\nWith only one track available so far, in the form of the melodic indie number _Eyes On Sunrise_, it’s guaranteed to have the LDN scene-kids foaming at the mouth. It’s not that this debut effort from **BUIL\\_DINGS** is offensive on the ears; in fact, it’s pleasantly listenable, yet rarely strays from it’s comfort zone. The **Foals** influence is all too prominent and mimicked throughout _Eyes On Sunrise_, most notoriously through the shimmering guitars and subtle vocals. It’s quite perplexing and unfortunate in truth because **BUIL\\_DINGS** clearly know their way around a song, here’s hoping they strive to carve out their own sound once they’ve found their feet.\n\n [E Y E S O N S U N R I S E](http://soundcloud.com/buildings/e-y-e-s-o-n-s-u-n-r-i-s-e) by [B U I L\\_D I N G S](http://soundcloud.com/buildings)",
