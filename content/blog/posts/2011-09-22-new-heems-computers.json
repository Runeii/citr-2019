The EP, entitled **_[Nehru Jackets](http://nehrujackets.tumblr.com/)_**, is due for release on January 1 2012.  If you’ve been following the exploits of **Heems**’ solo career then you’ve no doubt heard the majority of the EP. According to the man himself, it will contain the tracks **_[‘Womyn aka Hitch’](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIvfl3ME-bw)_**, **_‘Swate’_**, **_[‘NYC Cops’](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VFfQ8qXD58)_** and the paranoid little jam streaming below. All of which have been streaming, at least in some form, on the Internet for a while now.\n\nStream the new track below.",
