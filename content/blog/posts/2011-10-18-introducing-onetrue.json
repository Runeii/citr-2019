  "body": "This simplistic electro-bliss comes courtesy of London’s **onetrue**.\n\nTheir self-titled debut EP is a magical combination of atmospheric soundscapes and intimate sampled arrangements, drawing the listener in to a vibrantly colourful experience. I can imagine parts of this EP being rapped over, whilst other sections make for elegantly enticing breakdowns. It’s repetitive in form, but not to the point of proving dull or misinformed; portrayed excellently by the stunning _XIVXIV_, composed almost entirely of a basic piano chords and a drum machine. Check out **onetrue’s** debut EP over at their [bandcamp](http://onetrue.bandcamp.com/), where it’s available for free download.",
