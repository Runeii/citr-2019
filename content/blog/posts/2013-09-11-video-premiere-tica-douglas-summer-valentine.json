  "body": "Lifted from her new LP of the same title, **Tica Douglas’s** _Summer Valentine_ captures the saddening nostalgia that embraces the last few days of the warmer months.\n\nMusically, there’s hints of Mazzy Star and Feist amidst the fragile longing of the track, which builds around Douglas’ stunning vocals. The video is cloaked in the glowing embers of a dying summer, before exploding into an epic, firework fuelled finale. Check out the Gracie Pizzo directed video below, and stream the record in full underneath.\n\n[Tica Douglas – Summer Valentine (Official Video)](http://vimeo.com/74082421) from [gracie pizzo](http://vimeo.com/graciepizzo) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com).",
