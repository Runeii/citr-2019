  "body": "Following the 2010 breakout of mancunian heavy-poppers **WU LYF**, it became a real possibility that their individuality and creativity would spark the uprising of a new wave of honest, original guitar bands.\n\nAlthough a few copycats were to be expected, the endless drivel rolled out by the conveyor-belt of indie music came as a slight surprise.\n\nFrom the cliché beach romance to the haircuts and ankle-length chinos, **Coasts** prove once again that musical substance is no longer a requirement in the modern indie game. With lyrics so blatantly torn out of a 12-year-old girl’s diary, their growing fan base truly highlights the necessity of an expensive PR team. Intriguingly accompanied by the enlightening slogan: “World, this is Oceans. Oceans, this is the world.”, it appears all hope is, in fact, lost.",
