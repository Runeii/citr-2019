With a bunch of live dates coming up over the next couple of months, including support slots with Darlia and POND, their new track, _Wild Heart_ places them firmly as one of the most exciting acts to emerge from London in recent times. Fusing ’60’s psychedelia with snappy, memorable choruses, it’s everything Miles Kane promised, but never delivered on. Early days for the group, however there’s more than enough here to suggest that **Sun Machine** are ready for the big time.",
