There’s only so much Prince I can take.\n\nAnyway, the new cut from Oxford producer, **[Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/12725-mpfree-totally-enormous-extinct-dinosaurs-dream-on/ \"MPfree: Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs – Dream On\")** is pretty fucking rad.\n\nHis debut LP, _Trouble_, is out June 11 in the UK via [Polydor](http://www.polydor.co.uk/) and the next day in the U.S. via [Casablanca](http://www.casablanca-music.com/).",
