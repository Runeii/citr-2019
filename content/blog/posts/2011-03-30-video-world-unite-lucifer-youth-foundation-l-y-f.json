As well as releasing this video yesterday, they also announced details of their debut album, titled Go Tell Fire To The Mountain, released on 13/6/11. It is believed that L Y F will be the first official single from their debut LP, and it’s not a bad way to announce yourselves. The song itself makes use of their elaborate semi-screamed vocal parts, with the refrain “I’ll love you forever!” forming the focal point of the track. Oh and stay with it to the end of the track to see a clip taken from one of Ol’ Dirty Bastard’s infamous hilarious interviews.",
