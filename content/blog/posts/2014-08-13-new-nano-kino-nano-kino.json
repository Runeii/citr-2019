  "body": "Late night Bandcamp trawling is a safe, if not haphazard, retreat.\n\nPerhaps hoping to find something calming in anticipation of heading to bed, I instead found the debut self-titled effort from Nano Kino. As with so many first time Bandcamp uploads, there is little to no accompanying information, however within the track itself is a strong, endearing essence that feels like it is only beginning to emerge. Confident vocals are matched by a driving guitar line, all soaked in a fuzzy lo-fi veneer.\n\nIt’s by no means the finished product, but there is something undeniably enjoyable about this early effort from Nano Kino.\n\n<a href=\"http://nanokino.bandcamp.com/album/nano-kino\">NANO KINO by Nano Kino</a>",
