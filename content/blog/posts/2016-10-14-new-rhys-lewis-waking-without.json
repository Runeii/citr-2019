  "body": "Really soulful vibes here from London’s **Rhys Lewis** on his official debut, _Waking Up Without You_.\n\nThere’s certainly elements of the likes of Leon Bridges, not to mention obvious influences like Sam Cooke and Otis Redding, but with a rockier drive behind it – whilst the songwriting is no frills attached and straight to the point – proving devilishly addictive. Check out Waking Up Without You below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
