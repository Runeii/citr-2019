Well it’s a pretty emotionally desolate song to be honest; any piece of music that finishes with the line _‘I don’t want to die’_ is sure to be fairly hard-hitting.\n\nThis first track from North American duo **Pacific Empire** is a bleak yet beautiful piece of work from Spokane musician **Cameron Gorman** and Montreal’s **Velvet Glacier**, aka **Rémi Boudrias-Dussault**. _Death Song_ is the first track produced by this collaboration, and sets a melancholic tone, keeping instrumental sections to an ambient minimum and relying upon the sharp vocals to guide the track. Mixing lo-fi recording methods with shoegaze inspired effects, it’s despairing honest and wholly endearing. Downbeat and depressing it may be, but boy is it magnificent.",
