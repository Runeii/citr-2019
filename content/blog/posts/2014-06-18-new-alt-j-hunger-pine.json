  "body": "Now legitimately one of the biggest bands in the UK, if not the world, Leeds trio **Alt-J** (having seen the departure of Gwil Sainsbury) are set to release their hugely anticipated sophomore record in September.\n\nHunger of the Pine, the first cut taken from **_This Is All Yours_** out 22 September, isn’t too far a deviation from the sound which saw them claim the Mercury prize in 2012, yet feels more atmospheric, and dare I say it, more indebted to the likes of Radiohead, or perhaps more pointedly, Portishead. And yes, that is a Miley Cyrus sample (taken from [4×4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcp9AFwj2GE&feature=kp)).
