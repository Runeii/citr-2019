Unfortunately, I missed the grand finale tour the Alchemists conducted, however, I took on my own quest one sunny autumnal afternoon, map in hand, to go on some kind of art-easter-egg hunt. I found no chocolate but saw many visual treats – _on da streets. _\n\nKeep your eyeballs peeled for future happenings of the Alchemists. Anything that can _ease the queases_ of City Road seductions are winners in my book.\n\nFor more info of the festival, click [here](http://emptywallsfestival.blogspot.co.uk/), and more about Modern Alchemists, click [here](http://modernalchemists.blogspot.co.uk/). #gallery-1 { margin: auto; } #gallery-1 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } #gallery-1 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-1 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } /\\* see gallery\\_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php \\*/\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/1390745_10153364861330282_64097334_n-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/24760-exhibition-review-empty-walls/attachment/1390745_10153364861330282_64097334_n)\n\nPhlegm\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-shot-2013-10-26-at-16.17.19-150x150.png)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/24760-exhibition-review-empty-walls/attachment/screen-shot-2013-10-26-at-16-17-19)\n\nColour Doomed\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_3324-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/24760-exhibition-review-empty-walls/attachment/img_3324)\n\nPhilip Morgan\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_3340-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/24760-exhibition-review-empty-walls/attachment/img_3340)\n\nHb\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_3342-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/24760-exhibition-review-empty-walls/attachment/img_3342)\n\nKera\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_9819-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/24760-exhibition-review-empty-walls/attachment/img_9819)\n\nPhlegm\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_3279-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/24760-exhibition-review-empty-walls/attachment/img_3279)\n\nPhilip Morgan\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/try-you-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/24760-exhibition-review-empty-walls/attachment/try-you)",
