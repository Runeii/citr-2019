The solo project of ‘Patty’, his new EP entitled _**No Bloke**_ is a dreamy journey through hazy vocals and reverb heavy synths, proving both relaxing and beauteous at the same time. Opener _Triple Back Flip_ is hugely **Washed Out** influenced with, dare I say it, chillwave roots shining through. Aside from softly murmured harmonies, all **Noble Oak’s** work is instrumental, however it’s still brilliantly endearing and desirably personal. As a debut release, it’s fantastically confident, and nigh on perfect production wise, even if it is grounded in simplicity. Check out a couple of my choice picks from _**No Bloke**_ below, and head over to **Noble Oak’s** [bandcamp](http://nobleoak.bandcamp.com/) to pick up the EP.\n\n [Twenty Past Four](http://soundcloud.com/nobleoak/twenty-past-four) by [Noble Oak](http://soundcloud.com/nobleoak)\n\n [Perfect Triple Backflip](http://soundcloud.com/nobleoak/01-perfect-triple-backflip) by [Noble Oak](http://soundcloud.com/nobleoak)",
