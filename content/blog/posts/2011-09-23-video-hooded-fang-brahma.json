I had moved up north for a few months and frankly, I needed something emotive and fun to get me through.\n\nThankfully those times are over, I move back into my place in London on Monday, yet the music still moves me. It’s just so fucking pure. The video that dropped for the band’s latest single, **_Brahma_**, is equally so. Made by fine artist **Jake Pauls**, it follows a bird in flight. It’s simply drawn and composed; yet it manages to invoke the complex feelings of freedom in the most inspiring of ways.\n\nStream the video below.\n\n[HOODED FANG – BRAHMA](http://vimeo.com/29458847) from [DAPS RECORDS](http://vimeo.com/dapsrecords) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
