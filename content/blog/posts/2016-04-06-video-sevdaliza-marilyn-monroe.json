  "body": "Caught **SEVDALIZA** playing at SXSW last year, in a rather greasy converted night-club, surrounded by rowdy music industry exec’s downing shots of tequila.\n\nNot the most encouraging setting to see a gig; yet she handled it brilliantly, with a performance as hypnotising as it was invigorating. This new video for last years’ single, _Marilyn Monroe_, is an FKA Twigs-esque exploration of the human body; both bizarre and thrillingly addictive. Check it out below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
