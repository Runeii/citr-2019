  "body": "Several months back I wrote **Friends** off as a one trick pony, but now it seems I’m having to revise my opinion on the Brooklyn group, with their new track _Home_ being arguably their best release to date.\n\nA far shot from the god awful drivel that was last years hit single _I’m His Girl_, the quirky **Talking Heads**\\-esque percussion and addictive vocals combine perfectly to form a late 80’s inspired number, destined to pack out sweaty dancefloors at the trendiest indie venues. _Home_ is taken from their upcoming debut LP _**Manifest!**_ out 4 June, which you can pre-order [here](http://smarturl.it/manifestrt).",
