  "date": "2017-01-30T15:39:09",
  "body": "**Henry Jamison** has already cemented his place as one of my favourite songwriters of the past few years, with his debut EP, The Rains, featuring several of my most played tracks of 2016.\n\nTaking a slightly different approach on his latest release, a cover of Gordon Lightfoot’s 1970’s classic If You Could Read My Mind, he proves he’s equally adept with the songwriting of others. Allowing his wistful, distinctive vocal to take central stage, he manages to make the track entirely his own; which is no easy task when dealing with such a personal composition. With an upcoming tour underway in a few days time (dates below), and more releases scheduled for 2017, Henry Jamison is set to blossom. Check out If You Could Read My Mind below.\n\n  \n![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/16298424_1922521597976799_3907816743127695312_n-300x300.jpg)",
