  "body": "**Flatsound’s** _**I Clung To You Hoping We’d Both Drown**_ was one of my favourite releases of last year, and is still a regular player on tiresome bus journeys.\n\nHis new track is another example of his criminally underrated eloquence and knack for transferring his thoughts into musical form. Retelling the story of a relationship in turmoil and questioning the authenticity of their partners love, _If You Love Me, Come Clean_ is devastatingly relatable, which ultimately, is what makes it such a fantastic listen.\n\nCheck it out below, and grab a free download if it tickles your heartstrings.",
