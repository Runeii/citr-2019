  "body": "For a band we’re putting on today, we’ve covered zero pieces of music from the Peckham based post-rock outfit, **Oxbow Lakes**.\n\nHopefully the show today will finally and sufficiently shine light on their sublime music, at least on our pages. Our gig coincides with the release of their new single, **_Geiger_**, and it’s truly a spectacle. At times blistering, in others serein and sedate, it wanders quite effortlessly into sparse and tragic nether zones that never fail to hit very fucking hard. Hit play below, we’ll see you at the Montague Arms tonight.\n\n**[RSVP](https://www.facebook.com/events/314147398734749/?fref=ts)**",
