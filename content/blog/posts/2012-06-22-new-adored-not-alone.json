  "body": "Ah, here’s a slice of ‘fall-head-over-heels-in-love’ dream pop from LA four piece **Adored**.\n\nTitled _Not Alone_, it’s three minutes of soaring shoegaze riffs and reverb drenched vocals, ready to whisk you away to a happier place, preferably where **Reverend & The Makers** don’t exist. So it’s a little rough around the edges, and the lyrics are lost beneath layers of distortion, but hey, it’s still bloody brilliant. Check out _Not Alone_ below and keep up with **Adored** via their [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/adoredsound).\n\n<a href=\"http://adored.bandcamp.com/track/not-alone\">Not Alone by Adored</a>",
