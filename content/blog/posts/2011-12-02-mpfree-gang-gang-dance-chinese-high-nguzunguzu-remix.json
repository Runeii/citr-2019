  "date": "2011-12-02T20:03:45",
  "body": "I may have not given **Gang Gang Dance**‘s newest album _Eye Contact_ enough attention, but they’re still a great band.\n\nI just can’t take them seriously since that track with **Tinchy Stryder**. You know the one. That’s not to say it’s a bad track either (in fact it’s my favourite track on _Saint Dymphna_) – but more to the point, they do attract talent of a similar certain calibre.\n\nSince releasing this new one, they’ve been remixed brilliantly by **Lee ‘Scratch’ Perry**, and now LA-based trendy duo **NGUZUNGUZU** have had their turn – and the lovely folks at 4AD thought they’d treat us for free!  The duo really are converging with the distinctive **Night Slugs** sound, thanks to their dabblings with sister label **Fade To Mind** (run by the excellent **Kingdom**, of all people). The remix is unmistakably catchy, turning the original into a chopped-up tribal drum infestation with retro sampling, vocals hopping about playfully, and the usual necessary amounts of ‘n-tsh’ house percussion. This is a great little footstepper, layered and sequenced as acutely as any of **NGUZUNGUZU**‘s own productions. Cop this one yo.\n\n_Stream and download NGUZUNGUZU’s mix of Chinese High below._",
