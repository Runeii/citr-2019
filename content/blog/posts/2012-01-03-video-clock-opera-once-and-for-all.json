  "body": "**Clock Opera** have featured on almost every _**‘Sound of 2012’**_ list, well, aside from [**CitR’s**](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13083-sound-of-2012-part-i-josh/) that is. However that’s not to say they won’t be successful; they’ve got the backing of **NME**, the **Guardian** and with **Everything Everything** having just experienced such a wonderful twelve months, it seems inevitable that **Clock Opera** will go the same way. Their new video for _Once And For All_ is pretty darn cute, fuck your cliched ‘Rihanna making out with some slick dude in a car-park’, who wants to watch that anyway? Documenting an elderly couple and the various intricacies of their ‘turbulent’ relationship, director **Ben Strebel** captures it all, wrinkles included. Suddenly growing old doesn’t seem so bad.",
