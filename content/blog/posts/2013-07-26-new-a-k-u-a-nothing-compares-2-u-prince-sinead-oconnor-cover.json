  "date": "2013-07-26T14:37:55",
  "body": "It’s not every day that you get to open for the future Princess of pop, aka Miss **Solange Knowles**, let alone impressing her so much that you get asked to sing back-up vocals for her.\n\nObviously, given my love for **A K U A**, I can’t say that I’m surprised with her recent success, and on the strength of her debut EP, it’s thoroughly deserved. On this new track, a cover of **Prince’s** _Nothing Compares 2 U_ (although most famously recorded by **Sinéad O’Connor**… before she went bat-shit crazy…). A notoriously difficult track to cover, **A K U A** more than does it justice, shining a modern, very current sound upon the single from 1990. Check it out below, record exclusively for [Rookie Mag](http://rookiemag.com/).",
