  "body": "With such pieces titled _How to Escape an Art Exhibition_ and _The Count_ in which as soon as the viewer enters the gallery is right away ten counted out of it by a Boxing referee and then ousted by a burly bouncer, Demelza Watts isn’t going to be your average artist.\n\nIn fact, you may even wonder if you’re actually in an art exhibition at all. Demelza plays with your expectations of a gallery, creating these socially engaging and time based situational pieces that you may or may not see or even realize you’re a part of.\n\nHer _Waiting Room Art_, demonstrates this perfectly, several islands of a waiting room greets you at the entrance of the gallery, carpeted, with chairs and potted plants and several people sitting, waiting, but doing absolutely nothing, which also welcomes the idea of waiting as an endurance test. I don’t know the last time I sat at the doctors without fidgeting nervously with one bland magazine or another, but this uncanny scene of people waiting without such restlessness, suddenly makes you question this reality that’s been set up in front of you, you’ll have one eye on it for the rest of the exhibition so you can see immediately the slightest change in the sitters. Your gran might even rest her weary legs without noticing shes a performance artist.\n\nDemleza’s work is at the Wimbledon College of Art Degree Show till 22nd June\n\nFor her website click [HERE](http://cargocollective.com/demelzawatts).\n\nExamples of her work are below\n\n#gallery-1 { margin: auto; } #gallery-1 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 25%; } #gallery-1 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-1 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } /\\* see gallery\\_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php \\*/\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/How-to-escape-an-Art-Exhibition-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22641-artist-profile-demelza-watts/attachment/how-to-escape-an-art-exhibition)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/The-Count-150x150.jpeg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22641-artist-profile-demelza-watts/attachment/the-count)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/The-Waiting-Room-150x150.jpeg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22641-artist-profile-demelza-watts/attachment/the-waiting-room)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Waiting-Room-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22641-artist-profile-demelza-watts/attachment/waiting-room)",
