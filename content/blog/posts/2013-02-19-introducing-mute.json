What followed was one of the most inward, elegant and graceful pieces of hiphop I’ve heard in a long time. The gentle plucking found in _Here I Am_ clashes and intertwines with the furious vocal samples that litter the track, exploring a very clear concept amongst the groove. _Bad Dreams_ is perhaps the weaker of the 2 tracks, struggling to find a destination aside from some rather beautiful sample arrangements, regardless, it’s a rather striking entry into the ring from this London based producer.",
