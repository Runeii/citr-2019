  "body": "Glasgow’s [**Apache Sun**](https://www.</p><p>facebook.com/apachesunband/timeline?ref=page_internal) is probably UK’s best kept secret that will have many ears out there rattling from joy. **Kris Mitchell**, **Pete Bruce** and **David Noble** move with remarkable ease from **Tame Impala**‘s hazy psychedelic pop (the fantastic **The Rain That Never Came**) to ’60s inspired psychedelia in the style of **Allah Las** (listen to the splendid **Backseat Driver**) and from there to the haunting Arabesque rock n’ roll perfection of **Club Noir**. In each of their songs you’ll find a stimulating groove, produced in a flawless albeit seemingly DIY style, leaving anticipation for when their next song will arrive. In conclusion, [**Apache Sun**](https://www.facebook.com/apachesunband/timeline?ref=page_internal) are one of the best emerging acts that 2014 has offered us thus far.",
