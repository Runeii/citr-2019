  "body": "Having [Introduced](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13922-introducing-trap-house-collective/) Austin’s **Trap House Collective** a couple of weeks back, the group have made another track available to download, in the form of the lovelorn _T.C.B.L. (This Can’t Be Love)_. As with previous tracks, the **Drake** influence is fairly pronounced, but not to the point of purely creating a carbon copy; for one, the rapping is better. Production wise it’s perfect as well, sounding far slicker than other artists recording on similar budgets. Check out _T.C.B.L._ below, and download it in exchange for your email.\n\n<a href=\"http://traphousecollective.bandcamp.com/track/t-c-b-l\">T.C.B.L. by Trap House Collective</a>",
