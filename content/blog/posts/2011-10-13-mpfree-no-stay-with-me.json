  "body": "Hiding behind a web of mystery and ambiguity is a strategy being adopted by more and more bands looking to grab the short attention span of potential listeners.\n\nWhilst the official **[NO](http://www.facebook.com/NOMUSICFORME?sk=wall)** [soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/nomusicforme/tracks?page=1) has almost fifty tracks, and attributes them to a certain **Bradley Hanan Carter**, it appears that it’s only in the past month or so that **Carter** has really begun to instill a driving force behind **NO**. New single _Stay With Me_ is a baritone led ballad, proving remorseful and drowned in unrequited longing, with Carter yearning _‘stay with me, isn’t there a place for me inside your heart?’_. Comparisons are easily drawn to **The National**, in both the sound and songwriting structure, and although **NO** may not quite be up on the same level as the Ohio five piece, _Stay With Me_ is a promising step forward.\n\nCheck out _Stay With Me_ below, and download it for free.\n\n [Stay With Me](http://soundcloud.com/nomusicforme/no-stay-with-me) by [NO.](http://soundcloud.com/nomusicforme)",
