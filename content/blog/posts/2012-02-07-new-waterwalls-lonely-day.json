  "date": "2012-02-07T18:20:39",
  "body": "This debut track from Paris’s **Waterwalls** may well be ‘chillwave by numbers’, but hey, if it works, why change it, right? So it’s very much **Neon Indian** meets **Washed Out**, yet it’s arguably better than half the tracks on either of the respective albums released by those two artists last year.\n\nSynth heavy and vocals burdened with reverb, _Lonely Day_ isn’t carving out new genres, and it’s certainly not going to spawn a host of copycat artists, however simply put, it doesn’t need to. Check out _Lonely Day_ below, and grab a free download if you want.\n\n<a href=\"http://waterwalls.bandcamp.com/track/lonely-day\">Lonely Day by Waterwalls</a>",
