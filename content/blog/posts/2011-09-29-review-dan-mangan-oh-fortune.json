What happened to you? What horrendous, depressing event was inflicted on you in the last few years? In the past, the albums of Canadian folk artist **Dan Mangan** have hardly been easy-listening, and sure, there was always an underlying sense of sadness to the way that Mangan composed his songs, but it was done in a way that kept things optimistic. What we have here in **_Oh Fortune_** is something even grimmer, darker, and really rather more depressing.\n\nThe contrast with past albums that is initially more obvious though, is the instrumental composition of each song on the album. From the opening track, _About As Helpful As You Can Be Without Being Any Help At All_, which features Mangan’s trademark voice backed by what could very well be a full orchestra, it’s clear that the formula used on past albums – instrumentation taking a backseat to Mangan’s vocal work – has, if not quite been abandoned, certainly been altered. That is not to say, however, that the vocals on **_Oh Fortune_** are any worse for wear – much of his previous success has been based on his incredibly powerful voice, and that voice is just as strong on this record as ever – most recognisably in _Daffodil_, a minimalist, downbeat track that comes out as one of the album’s best – but the instrumentalisation of **_Oh Fortune_**, unlike past albums, goes past a few trumpets and the twang of an electric guitar and into orchestral/full-band territory.\n\nLyrically, _**Oh Fortune**_ is (to put it bluntly) extremely downbeat. Although Mangan’s previous works were hardly sunshine and roses when it came to his storytelling, there was always a strange sense of charm and even a little bit of humour to the way he sang. Here, there is nothing of the sort. From “_Cast out to see/Friendly with waves/There were sharks beneath me/Hungry for meat”_ to Mangan asking “_Should the daylight forgive the awful things that I did?”,_ it seems pretty clear that the charm is dead. This is, of course, not necessarily a bad thing – replacing the mixture of charm and sadness is all-out melancholy, and had Mangan kept to the instrumental style of _**Nice, Nice, Very Nice**_ and **_Postcards and Daydreams_**, it might not have worked quite so well. Luckily, the addition of large backing vocal sections (such as in _Rows of Houses_) strings (as in _About As Helpful…_) and just a little bit of vocal manipulation (_Daffodil)_, means that the album presents a radical enough change in musical direction to justify a descent into the lyrical pit of despair.\n\nAll in all, then, this isn’t music to listen to on a sunny day when you’re feeling good. **_Oh Fortune_** never, unfortunately, throws out a truly _Robots_\\-esque classic either. However, the change in musical direction makes the album intruiging enough, and some tracks (such as _Daffodil, Oh Fortune_ and _Rows of Houses_, for example) do stand out as being particularly brilliant. This adds up to an album which, though never quite reaching the heights of **_Nice, Nice, Very Nice_**, is absolutely worth a listen – or, if you’re feeling down, ten.\n\n[Check out **Dan Mangan’s** acoustic session (including **Oh Fortune**) for us this Summer.](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/8705-exclusive-unplugged-session-dan-mangan/)",
