  "body": "Have been a big fan of Brooklyn’s **Eugene Marie** since they emerged six months back.\n\nNow with a seven track debut EP under their belts, they’re really showing off the sort of diversity in sound that I’d really hoped they’d manage to find. Alongside almost Haim-esque pop songs like _Can’t Take That Away From Me_, fits in more experimental, slow burners like _It’ll Never Be This Good, _channeling the likes of Maggie Rogers and Sylvan Esso. There’s an undeniable elegance and beauty to their music; here’s hoping for plenty more.",
