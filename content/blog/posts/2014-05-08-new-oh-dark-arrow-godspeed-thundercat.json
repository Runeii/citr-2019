  "body": "Some fresh hip-hop from Cape Town, a part of the world with a wealth of hip-hop, most of which I haven’t dipped my toes into yet.\n\n**Oh! Dark Arrow** are a great start. The production isn’t too dissimilar to the work of **Hot Sugar**, coupled with the darkness of say, **Ibn Inglor** (at least at points). The flows address this tonal dexterity wholeheartedly. Funky, fun and at times rambling, their rhymes hold the same weirdness as **Young Fathers**, while holding onto the laid back early 90’s vibes found in early **Digable Planets** material. All in all, more than enough going on to warrant a full listen to their debut mixtape/LP.\n\nPretty eager to hear more.",
