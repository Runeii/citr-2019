  "body": "Eighteen year old **SEYD** packs a punch on her debut track, _This Ain’t Easy_.\n\nIt’s the sort of early 00’s R&B influenced vibe that’s all the rage right now in electro-pop music, but done exceptionally well and showcasing absolutely bucket loads of potential. Early days for the Birmingham based singer, but with an EP scheduled for release at the start of next year, featuring This Ain’t Easy, alongside other tracks produced by Motherhood, there’s more than enough here to suggest SEYD is well worth keeping an eye on. Check out her debut track below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
