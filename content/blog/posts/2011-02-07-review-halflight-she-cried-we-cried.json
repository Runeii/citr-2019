Whilst this probably isn’t too difficult to perceive as thousands of songs are written every day, it’s a moving and true testament to the quality humans have of spilling their hearts through the medium of music; in this case, the hauntingly beautiful She Cried by Halflight being the track in question. Sure it’s on the verge of rotting your teeth with sweetness, yet it’s unashamedly so. “The beach, you remember the beach, and what I said to you” croons Halflight lead singer Chris Cookson, it’s been tearing at my heartstrings all week.\n\nWith their debut EP Shine On released recently, and with a BBC Introducing session later in the month, be sure to keep your ears pricked for their tunes over the coming months. Check out She Cried (We Cried) below, as well as their EP, from which all profits go to Cancer Research UK.\n\n [She Cried (We Cried)](http://soundcloud.com/halflightmusic/she-cried-we-cried) by [HALFLIGHT](http://soundcloud.com/halflightmusic)",
