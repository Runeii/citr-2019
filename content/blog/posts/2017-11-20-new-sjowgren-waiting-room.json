  "body": "Californian indie outfit Sjowgren return to close out the year with the fantastic single Waiting Room.\n\nWith numerous parts and dynamic shifts it’s almost dizzying hearing the track flow through vicious crash heavy pre-chorus’ before drifting into bridges carried by palm muted guitars and soft harmonised vocals. A lot of fun can be had with the hard to pin down nature of the track and it would be very interesting to see how it translates live. Check it out in the link below.",
