  "body": "It’s been around 4 months since we covered emerging hip-hop producer, **Mute**.\n\nAn enigma in many way; he crate digs, relies on samples and focuses on a raw and often brutal quality of recording, a la **Dilla**, yet he also manages to construct composed, delicately emergent music. Despite engaging and respecting the more conformed aspects of what instrumental hip-hop can often be. Sometimes a catchy loop isn’t enough. The beat is never the window dressing to the flow. While saying this, its arguable that **Mute**’s music is damaged by the missing element, a great MC. When **Mute** has this he could, in my opinion, be the whole package.",
