Re-working the hook of **Cathy Dennis**’ ‘T_ouch Me (All Night Long)_’, the track oozes with a summer atmosphere. Carefree and soulful, it glistens with a longing for the sun and boasts a romance that only our current season can muster. Stream the track below, and head on over to [**Cascine**](http://www.cascine.us/) on July 12 to buy the _Atlantic EP._\n\n [Southern Shores – 04 Night Is Young](http://soundcloud.com/cascine/04-night-is-young) by [CASCINE](http://soundcloud.com/cascine)",
