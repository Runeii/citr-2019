As [Miasmah](http://www.miasmah.com/recordings/cat.html#MIACD016) records state in their own press release, it would be very easy to pass of the LP as soundtrack music and little else, but there’s a whole multi-faceted plot current that’s explored, with little need for visual aids. It’s confident in sonic expression.\n\nIt’s varied as well, always keeping the listener on their toes, taking influences from opera and yes, musical scores, it manages transports in a way that is just as exciting as it is ambitious. Stream it below.\n\n [Kreng – Grimoire](http://soundcloud.com/miasmah/sets/kreng-grimoire) by [miasmah](http://soundcloud.com/miasmah)",
