  "body": "The project of Prague’s Petr Pliska, **Pink Gloves** drifts in somewhere between the resplendent, atmospheric pop of Washed Out, and the nighttime inspired Kavinsky led Drive soundtrack.\n\nWhilst hinting at late 70s disco inspirations, there’s an melancholia and underlying sense of sadness to new single _80s Girls_, his follow up to online hit, [Fading Stars](https://soundcloud.com/openinglight/pink-gloves-fading-stars-1). It’s a song of lust, yet ultimately unfulfillment; simultaneously cinematic yet daringly intimate. Check it out below.",
