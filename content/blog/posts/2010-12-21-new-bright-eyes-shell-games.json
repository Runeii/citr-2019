A project headed by Nebraska born songwriter Conor Oberst, Bright Eyes have nine full length releases recorded to date, as well as countless rare and exclusive tracks. Two months before the official release, and the group have decided to give away album track Shell Games for free, in exchange for joining the Saddle Creek mailing list. Their much anticipated album is their first in four years, since 2007’s Cassadaga, which saw Bright Eyes scrapping their acoustic based folk sound, opting for a far more upbeat, popular approach.\n\nShell Games continues where Conor Oberst and The Mystic Valley Band left off, emphasizing Conor’s versatile and captivating vocals, before gathering pace and launching into an jovial pop tune. The chorus belongs in a top ten chart hit, yet the lyrics are superior to their counterparts, it’s a welcome return from Bright Eyes, although it’s far from the emotional wreckage that are his previous records. Shell Games is available for a free download by entering your email address below.",
