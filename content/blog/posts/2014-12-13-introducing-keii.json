Everything about his music is energetic, brash, vibrant, off the wall and ultimately completely batshit insane, yet deliriously brilliant. I can’t even begin to work out where the samples are lifted from, and perhaps for the best, perhaps it would remove some of the magic. Check out _fracture_, _relapse_ and his Childish Gambino remix below.",
