  "date": "2015-09-28T16:21:22",
  "body": "There’s a certain, simple beauty in an upbeat indie track; soaring guitars, a direct vocal line, and a story of unrequited love.\n\nNorwegian trio Great News deliver just that in their latest offering, and their second single, ‘Love Her’.\n\nFollowing on from supporting Unknown Mortal Orchestra, and a series of festivals across their native Norway, Great News are only just beginning to emerge into the spotlight. Carried by their own joyful buoyancy, there is already a strong sense of ability in their music, composed in such a manner that naturally draws in any unsuspecting listener. While ‘Love Her’ may feel like it could be the soundtrack of a summer, there is strong evidence here to support the suggestion that Great News’ music will transcend the seasons.",
