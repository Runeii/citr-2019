  "body": "Starting out as a fairly standard sounding acoustic guitar led number, **Luke Olson’s** _Memento_ soon blossoms into a beautifully moving composition, largely due to the production work of Haff Jraff (Danny Wells & Sucka Push).\n\nNot quite SOHN territory, and not quite as minimal as the elegance of RY X, it appears to be the first release from Luke Olson, and certainly builds anticipation for further music.",
