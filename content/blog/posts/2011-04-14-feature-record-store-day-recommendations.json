From the sublime, one-time-only limited edition classics to the somewhat more questionable releases, April 16th  is your chance to head down to a local record store, give them all your money, and walk away with some truly great music. To ease the pain of choosing from the endless list of releases, we’ve compiled a guide of the top ten must-buy records coming out on Saturday.\n\n**Daft Punk – Tron Legacy Soundtrack**\n\nAlright, love it or hate it, it’s still **Daft Punk**. What’s more is that this not only comes with an exclusive track, it’s also potentially the coolest vinyl you’ll ever see – translucent, blue, and very, very awesome.\n\n**Deerhoof – Friend Opportunity**\n\nThe experimental rock band re-releases its fantastic 2007 album with only 1000 copies. You might be lucky to get it, but be proud if you do – it’s a genuine classic.\n\n**Fleet Foxes – Helplessness Blues/Grown Ocean**\n\nA nice little two-track preview of the upcoming album from, arguably, the best folk band in the world – if anything, buy it for the cover art.\n\n**Gorillaz – The Fall**\n\nThis iPad-created album, released initially for free last Christmas, isn’t for everyone – it’s certainly very different to the **Gorillaz** you probably know – but it’s bound to be one of the more popular RSD releases, and certainly worth checking out.\n\n**Jimi Hendrix – Fire/Touch You**\n\nAn alternative version of one of Hendrix’s best ever songs, and a previously unreleased studio recording. How can you possibly not want this?\n\n**Mumford & Sons/Laura Marling – Dharohar Project**\n\nPost-breakup awkwardness between Mumford and Marling aside, it’s nice to see them both do something different – namely, collaborating with Indian folk musicians.\n\n**My Chemical Romance – Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na)**\n\nHah. Just kidding.\n\n**Nirvana – Hormoaning**\n\nYeah, **Foo Fighters** do have a release out for RSD, but if you’re looking for classic 90s grunge, this is where to go.\n\n**Panda Bear – Tomboy**\n\nAs good as any **AnCo** album, Noah Lennox’s latest solo album is a thing of true beauty. Definitely worth a buy.\n\n**The Flaming Lips – Heady Nuggs**\n\nPossibly the most mind-blowingly brilliant thing you could buy on Saturday. Five albums in one, including **Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots** and **The Soft Bulletin** – if you’ve never heard these albums before, this is your chance. Your exclusive, £100 chance. Sorry. Maybe your local record store will give it to you for a tenner.\n\n**The Naked and Famous – This Machine/No Light**\n\nA double EP from the up-and-coming New Zealand rock band. However, though this is a nice RSD exclusive, if you’re really wanting to get some South Pacific action, try to find their debut album, **Passive Me, Agressive You**. Not only is it a fantastic record, but it’s also one of the most beautiful-looking vinyls you’ll ever see.",
