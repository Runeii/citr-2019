  "body": "Coming in at well under two minutes, this debut track from **Hiding Face** may not be particularly substantial in length, but it more than makes up for that with its emotional punch.\n\nThe gruff Berninger-esque vocals of **Hiding Face** make the track what it is, paired with the poignant, ever-so self-depreciating lyrics ‘when I had feelings, I could talk to pretty girls without being a dick’, create a song that at first listen appears simplistic yet is deeply embedded with guilt and a craving for solitude.
