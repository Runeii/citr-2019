  "body": "Over the past couple of years, we’ve experienced somewhat of a shoegaze revival, with more acts seemingly taking influence from the dreamy, ethereal guitar sounds of the late 80’s.\n\n**The Horrors** and **The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart** both succeeded in opening up this reborn genre (aptly titled ‘nu-gaze’) to the mainstream media, whilst there are few ‘chillwave’ artists who would deny the effect the likes of **Ride** and **My Bloody Valentine** have had on their own creative output.\n\nHowever that’s not to say shoegaze was ever redundant as a genre, just bubbling gorgeously beneath the surface of mainstream recognition. One such band who are now beginning to receive their just desserts are Los Angeles five piece **Letting Up Despite Great Faults**. Over five years since they announced themselves on the scene with their debut EP **_Movement_**, and now with plaudits all over the world and fans at Pitchfork and Rolling Stone, **Letting Up Despite Great Faults** are readying the release of a new EP, entitled **_Paper Crush_**.\n\nThe shoegaze and dream pop inspirations are plain to see, with opener _Repeating Hearts_ fitting very nicely into the **Pale Saints** styled sound. The guitars are soothingly repetitive and the vocals are drenched in hazy reverb. The track to close _Paper Crush_, the slow burning _Aurora_ is heavily electronically driven and almost entirely instrumental, serves as a timely reminder as to the talent this three piece possess, in particular songwriter **Michael Lee**. A fitting way to end the release.\n\nYet as seen with **The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart**, **Letting Up Despite Great Faults** don’t just reinvent a sound; they succeed in embracing and adding to it, with the twee anthem _Teenage Tide_ portraying this sumptuously. A delightfully laid back teenage love song, destined to fill the playlists of starstruck young lovers. It’s on this track that **Letting Up Despite Great Faults** excel and display the sort of songwriting ability that will elevate them to the realms of their worthy peers.\n\n [Letting Up Despite Great Faults – Teenage Tide](http://soundcloud.com/lettingup/letting-up-despite-great-2) by [lettingup](http://soundcloud.com/lettingup)",
