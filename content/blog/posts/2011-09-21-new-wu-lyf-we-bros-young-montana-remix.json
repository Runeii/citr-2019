  "body": "With Manchester quartet **WU LYF** yesterday announcing the release of their new single _We Bros_, it also sparked a first for the controversial group.\n\nThe 12″ vinyl which features said album track will also be home to the first couple of official **WU LYF** endorsed remixes, courtesy of **Young Montana?** and **S.Maharba**. Earlier today **Young Montana?** made his attempt available to hear via his soundcloud, and it’s an extremely accomplished effort, morphing the track beyond recognition at times. There’s plenty of pitch bending and spliced beats dominating the remix, yet to it’s credit it’s not a straight out ‘made for indie clubs’ take on the Go Tell Fire album track, and instead is far more engaging. Check it out below.\n\n [WU LYF – We Bros (Young Montana? remix)](http://soundcloud.com/young-montana/wu-lyf-we-bros-young-montana) by [Young Montana?](http://soundcloud.com/young-montana)",
