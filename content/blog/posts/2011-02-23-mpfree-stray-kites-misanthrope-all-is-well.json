There’s a jaunty swing to the majority of their tracks, compiling a broad range of folk and acoustic influences to create a buoyant, lighthearted feeling throughout the songs. Having released their debut record One Day, Earth Time earlier last year, they are currently working on their next album, tentatively titled Mieux, set to be released later this year. Recently they have made two new tracks available for download, which show a maturity in their sound, that wasn’t quite realised on the debut record despite it’s vast potential and high points.\n\nBoth songs are hard to place in any genre, coming in somewhere between acoustic-punk and folk. The lyrics are a joy to behold at times, “if time were money, we’d still be dirt poor”, openly warbles Junior on Misanthrope. The other new track All Is Well is seemingly an ode to an almost forgotten lover, honest and alluring.
