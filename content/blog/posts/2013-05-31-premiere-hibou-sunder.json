  "date": "2013-05-31T13:58:13",
  "body": "Having well and truly made his mark with double A single [_Glow / Hollow_](https://soundcloud.com/petermichel/sets/glow-hollow), **Hibou**, the project of nineteen year old **Peter Michel** from Seattle returns with his hotly anticipated self-released new EP, **_Dunes_**. The opening track to be taken from it, _Sunder,_ is a lush, sprawling surf pop jam, channeling Wild Nothing and The Drums, alongside touches of The Cure. With songwriting this good and a cunning ear for a swelteringly addictive hook, Hibou is sure to have labels falling over themselves. _Sunder_ is available as a free download from Hibou’s [Bandcamp](http://hiboumichel.bandcamp.com/track/sunder) page, with the rest of EP released on 13 June.",
