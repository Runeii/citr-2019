Taken from **Deacon’s** forthcoming album _**America**_ out 27 August, _True Thrush_ is everything we’ve grown to love from the Baltimore composer. Erratic, danceable with touches of drug induced psychedelia. Check out _True Thrush_ below and pre-order _**America**_ [here.](http://dominorecordco.com/america)",
