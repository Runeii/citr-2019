However with the abundance of Adele, Winehouse and Duffy wannabes, it takes something a little bit special to stand out from the scenester inspired, hair obsessed crowd. Last year’s single Perfect signaled the intent of Leigh Mary Stokes, to create captivating, and enjoyable pop tunes, and her upcoming release Your Smile is no deviation from this trend.\n\nDespite summarizing the breakdown of a previous relationship, it’s vaguely uplifting, allowing the listener in on an absorbing segment of Leigh’s seemingly turbulent love life. Reminiscing of a lovers affectionate and alluring smile, whilst telling of the current emotional turmoil she is in, comes across as frighteningly honest and relevant to all of us. “You know I always loved you from the start” cries Leigh as Your Smile culminates; appealing, unique and strangely human, check it out below.\n\n [YOUR SMILE – Leigh Mary Stokes](http://soundcloud.com/manilla-pr/your-smile-leigh-mary-stokes) by [Manilla PR – Denise](http://soundcloud.com/manilla-pr)",
