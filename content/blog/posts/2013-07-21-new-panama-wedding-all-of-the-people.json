  "body": "Mark my words, **Panama Wedding** are going to be huge.\n\nTheir debut single, the gloriously upbeat _All Of The People_, has the sort of chorus that **Foster The People** would kill for, mixed with the slick, 90’s boyband feel of **The Neighbourhood**. So it’s out and out, no frills pop, which is likely to disappoint snooty, Pitchfork obsessives, but at the end of the day, it’s one of the finest new tracks of the year, and a mightily exciting first step for a very enticing new band. With top level management already on board, you can be expecting to hear a lot more from this New York outfit.",
