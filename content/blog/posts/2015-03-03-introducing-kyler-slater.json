  "body": "Listing Death Cab and Elliott Smith amongst his inspirations, it’s safe to say that **Kyler Slater** draws from earnest, heart-on-sleeves songwriters.\n\nWith a track kicking around online from as early as May 2013, this new three track release marks a considerable step up for Salt Lake City’s **Kyler Slater**, in songwriting and production quality. There’s elements of London Grammar in the guitar sound, as well as Vancouver Sleep Clinic and even Hozier on the powerful lead vocal; it’s an EP that gets better and better with repeated listens, with closer _On My Own_ being a stunning stand alone single. Check out all three tracks below, and pick up the EP from [Bandcamp](http://kylerslater.bandcamp.com/).
