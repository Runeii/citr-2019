  "body": "With a Q Award under their belt, as well as one of the finest albums of the year, Mancunian quartet **WU LYF** are rounding off the year by releasing a new single from their critically acclaimed debut record.\n\n_We Bros_ comes with remixes from tour mates **S. Mahabra** and **Young Montana?** alongside a brand new video. Directed by **Sam Pilling**, the five minute clip documents the now infamous **WU LYF** spirit of freedom, equality and uncensored expressionism. Following a group of youths breaking free from the shackles of an industrialised city, there’s a real sense of belonging in the video, one upon which the entire **WU LYF** experience is grounded.
