  "body": "Vancouver producer **Noble Oak** is rapidly becoming one of my favourite new artists around.\n\nHis _**No Bloke**_ EP wowed me last year, and his couple of tracks so far from 2012 have set the bar even higher. Since deciding to use his own vocals amongst his mesmerizing glo-fi productions, his work has taken on a whole new transcendental level. _Fast Summer_ is a self-described ‘dream and bass’ number, yet it’s far more beautiful than that genre suggests. Check out _Fast Summer_ below.",
