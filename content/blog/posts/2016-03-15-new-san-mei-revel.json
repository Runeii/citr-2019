  "body": "**San Mei** has been gone far too long.\n\nHer dreamy, ethereal pop appeared on my radar about three years back, and whilst releases have been few and far between, they’ve all showcased an artist with bundles of talent. Whilst it’s more niche pop than chart bothering radio drivel, you could certainly see San Mei penning an Ellie Goulding style ‘banger’ at some stage. Check out _Revel_ below.\n\nFollow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
