Released through Slowfoot Records, the record sees Hugh Jones following up his acclaimed ‘Dust EP’ with further experimentations under the post-dubstep banner. For a market saturated with various bedroom producers, this is an album which will stand out for its accessibility, whilst retaining a sense of creation and intrigue. From the minimalist glitches of ‘Dust Crawlers’ to the shaved brass of ‘To A New Day’, this is an album which is hugely danceable and yet intrinsically exploratory.\n\n [Crewdson – Gravity (Album)](http://soundcloud.com/crewdson/sets/crewdson-gravity-album) by [crewdson](http://soundcloud.com/crewdson)\n\nYou can pre-order here:[](http://bit.ly/jv8iDu)\n\n[http://bit.ly/jv8iDu](http://bit.ly/jv8iDu)  \n[http://bit.ly/m2ih0P](http://bit.ly/m2ih0P)",
