  "body": "New Jersey multi-instrumentalist [**TEEEL**](http://www.teeelmusic.com/) is a perfectionist, whether it’s working on his own material, or crafting remixes for others, his attention to detail is second to none. With his debut record _**AMULET**_ receiving critical acclaim across the blogosphere, and new material on the horizon, his unique brand of dream inspired electro-pop is sure to create even more of a stir in 2012. Having just released a new track, the 80’s disco influenced _The Lucania_, _**CitR**_ caught up with **TEEEL** to get a few questions answered. Check out the interview and a couple of tracks below.\n\n_CitR: What do you see as the main inspirations behind TEEEL, both musically and otherwise?_\n\n**Lately, I’ve been drawing inspiration from the weather changing over to winter. My recent tracks have been a bit darker than I normally write under the TEEEL name. I generally draw inspiration from movies, other musicians and artists, my friends and what mood I’m in. And sometimes, I’ll find a new synth sound and go from there. It really comes from everywhere, I guess.**\n\n_There appears to be quite an 80’s disco vibe to some of your stuff, especially new track The Lucania, would you agree with that assumption?_\n\n**Yeah, I have a collection of songs I’m finishing up now, some are dark and emotional dreamwave and some are light, fun and dancy. I usually bucket my song ideas in sub-styles on my computer and then eventually narrow down the songs I want to finish. “The Lucania” is actually a nod to my friend Chris Lucania. He was a big inspiration to me getting into metal and darker electronic music in the late 90s. I thought it was appropriate to give it away on Halloween. We are actually doing a show together to feature his paintings and I’m going to do a live performance.**\n\n [The Lucania](http://soundcloud.com/teeel/teeel-the-lucania) by [Teeel](http://soundcloud.com/teeel)\n\n_How much do you think the environment and area that you grew up in have impacted on the music that you create?_\n\n**It actually has made a major impact in my life. Living in NJ and being so close to both NY and Philly has spoiled me with talent as long as I can remember. There were loads of hard rock, punk and metal bands in my town. I played in a coupe bands and then eventually fell in love with drum and bass and electronic music. At the time, Philly had a massive scene and I was only 30 minutes away to seeing a headlining UK artist. It’s something that will always be a part of me.**\n\n_What’s your standard songwriting process, and what equipment/programs do you tend to use?_\n\n**I don’t really have an exact process. I’ll comp ideas and work on them for an hour or two. If I go back the next day and hear what I like, I’ll set up my hardware synths, record some guitars and lay in temporary vocals. From there, I finesse the song until I feel it’s finished. Some songs can come together in a night, some take a solid week to finish and about 75% of my ideas don’t see the light of day.**\n\n_What are your plans and future aspirations for TEEEL?_\n\n**I really would love to visit some other countries and rock out with my fans.**  \n**I’m hoping in the spring I’ll have a booking agent and can move forward. Other than playing more shows, I plan on continuing to push out new material.**\n\n [Falcon Lake – Moving On (TEEEL Remix)](http://soundcloud.com/teeel/moving-on-teeel-remix) by [Teeel](http://soundcloud.com/teeel)\n\n_If you had to describe your own music in three words, what would you say?_\n\n**Synths, Space and Dreams.**\n\n_And finally! On a less serious note…. if you could be any animal, what would you be, and why?_\n\n**Either a shark, because they are badass or a monkey because they are always having fun.**\n\n[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/teeelmusic)\n\n[Soundcloud](http://www.soundcloud.com/teeel)",
