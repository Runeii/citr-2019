  "body": "There’s little about [RÁJ](https://www.facebook.com/rajnoiseofficial) on the internet, but it hardly feels like you need all the babble about his background and inspirations in order to appreciate the beauty of this demo track. This is a headphone moment, best appreciated late at night. The softness of his falsetto voice glides over the minimal piano line, and somehow the subtleness of the song is the very thing which leaves it lingering in the mind.\n\nHis previously released track ‘Ghost’ is also worth a listen.
