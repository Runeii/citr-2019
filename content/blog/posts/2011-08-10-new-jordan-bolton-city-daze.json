  "body": "There’s something indefinitely unnerving about [**Jordan Bolton**](http://soundcloud.com/italianjab)’s latest piece of work, _City Daze_. Although the time of writing is unclear, it expresses and explores a modern frustration with our contemporary way of living, at a time when frustration and anger seems to be the only two words on the British youth’s lips.\n\nThe deadpan spoken word interludes paint a dark and isolated world, as the speaker “plans another workless week” a trickle of organ spreads through the track, cementing the uninviting, empty and discriminative world. It’s horrifyingly truthful in a time where all people want is answers.\n\nStream and download the tune below.\n\n [City Daze](http://soundcloud.com/italianjab/city-daze) by [Jordan Bolton](http://soundcloud.com/italianjab)",
