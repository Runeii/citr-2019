  "body": "Following the release of their stunning new LP, entitled _**Breakers**_, Somerville’s **Gem Club** have dropped a video for the penultimate track from the record; the epic five minute ballad _252_.\n\nOpening in what appears to be a slightly rundown hotel room, the clip is startlingly harrowing, documenting everyday situations in a realistic, yet unnerving manner. From a young lad frothing at the mouth during an epileptic fit, to an awkward couple making out in a decrepit living room, there’s something for any viewer to relate to, albeit in a slightly macabre way. There’s an underlying feeling of desolation, heart-wrenching pain, but most of all sympathy for the circumstances portrayed in the video, elegantly reflected in the song. Check out the video for _252_ below.\n\n[Gem Club – 252](http://vimeo.com/31211684) from [Gem Club](http://vimeo.com/gemclub) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
