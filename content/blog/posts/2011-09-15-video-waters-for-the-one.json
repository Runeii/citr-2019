  "body": "This new video from former **Port O’Brien** front man **Van Pierszalowski**, now recording under the moniker **WATERS**, may well be the most bizarre video you will ever see.\n\nFeaturing a crazed barber, old couples making out and plenty of psychedelic imagery, _For The One_ is quite an experience. Based around the concept of a twisted, distorted dream, it’s a far from serious production, and will most likely leave you wondering what the hell you’ve just spent the last four minutes watching. Thankfully, the track itself is a brilliantly energetic slice of guitar driven punk, far rawer and brash than any of **Pierszalowski’s** work with **Port O’Brien**. **WATERS** debut album _**Out In The Light**_ is released next Monday through [City Slang](http://www.cityslang.com/).",
