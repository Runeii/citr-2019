  "date": "2016-07-24T10:26:05",
  "body": "Having emerged as a sparkling talent a little under two years ago, NYC’s **Dominique** has been intricately honing her craft since then.\n\nWhilst last year found her experimenting with her own production methods, and dealing mainly in YouTube covers, she’s now gearing up to release a debut EP of original material, featuring lead single, [Good Girl](https://soundcloud.com/dominique/good-girl), and the recently released Love You Better. Showcasing arguably her slickest songwriting so far, it’s a more melancholic sound than we’re used to from her, but it works exceedingly well. Check out Love You Better below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
