  "body": "**Oleg Borsos** and **Mark Lechner** are **Polar Dear**, a self proclaimed ‘eurodance’ duo from Budapest, however don’t let that unbecoming tag put you off, as they are far more than your stereotypical eurotrash Cheeky Girls.\n\nDebut track _Even If I’m Late_ is a stomping **Bloc Party**\\-esque number; danceable and insanely catchy, probably how **Kele** intended his solo album to turn out to be honest. The video to accompany _Even If I’m Late_ is a gorgeously shot affair, drenched in relaxing light blues and distorted imagery. Oh, and a rather attractive young woman. Synth heavy and vocal driven, _Even If I’m Late_ is an ‘everyone to the dancefloor’ track in waiting, and an extremely promising snapshot of what is to come from **Polar Dear**.\n\nCheck out the video below, and head over to **Polar Dear’s** [bandcamp](http://polardear.bandcamp.com/) for a free download of Even If I’m Late.\n\n[Polar Dear – Even If I’m Late](http://vimeo.com/28206406) from [Polar Dear](http://vimeo.com/user8005920) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
