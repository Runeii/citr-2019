  "body": "Given that this is only the second track from Switzerland’s **CRISTALLIN**, the level of hype surrounding the producer is fairly impressive.\n\nWith his new video amassing almost 1,500 views in the space of 24 hours, and a whole host of positive comments concerning the combination of _Girl On A Motorcycle_ with it’s visuals, it’s clear that 2012 is going to be a big year for **Simeon Cristallin**. The video in question is a perfect accompaniment to the track; hazy and ethereal in nature with simply gorgeous colours swirling effortlessly throughout. It’s uplifting whilst remaining admirably fragile, opening itself up far more than the vast majority of electro-instrumental tracks do. _Girl On A Motorcycle_ is available for free download from **CRISTALLIN’s** [bandcamp](http://cristallin.bandcamp.com/track/girl-on-a-motorcycle).\n\n[CRISTALLIN // Girl On A Motorcycle](http://vimeo.com/32142838) from [Simeon Cristallin](http://vimeo.com/cristallin) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
