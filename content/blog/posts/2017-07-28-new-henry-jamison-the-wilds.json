  "date": "2017-07-28T12:24:46",
  "body": "**Henry Jamison** is one of my favourite songwriters of the past few years – there’s a real character and emotion to everything he puts his name to, and his latest track, _The Wilds_, is no exception.\n\nSimplistic yet utterly captivating, The Wilds is regally romantic and serves to build further anticipation for his debut album expected later in the year. Henry Jamison plays Bethnal Green Working Men’s Club with Rosie Carney on 5 October.",
