  "body": "On Sunday 5th May, Streetfest is putting on another explosive amalgamation of “street art” and live music.\n\nThe event, which is entering its 6th year, plays host to a number of exciting artists.\n\nThe one I’m most “hyped” about is headliner Oddisee. The barsmith has been putting out consistently excellent music for a couple of years and it’ll be interesting to see how his music works in a live setting.\n\nAside from the American rapper, there are a number of British MCs on the line-up, with Dot Rotten being the most prominent. You can also catch performances from the likes of DJ Vadim & DJ Nikki Beatnik, Livin Proof and Supa Dupa Fly.\n\nYou can find further information about Streetfest and buy tickets [here](http://www.streetfest.net/).",
