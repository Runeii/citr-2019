That record will probably always make me sad, not least because it’s so fucking heart wrenching, but also because I was under the impression that **Owen Ashworth** would never make music again. Rather wonderfully I came home later that day to find this whimsical, spiritually ecstatic tune in my inbox. It’s short, delicate and tells the story of a childhood pony. A new direction, a beautiful song and a perfect end to the day.\n\n[Whirlaway The Horse](http://soundcloud.com/advance-base/whirlaway-the-horse) by [Advance Base](http://soundcloud.com/advance-base)",
