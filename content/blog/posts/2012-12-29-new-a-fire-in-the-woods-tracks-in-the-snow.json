  "body": "Straight out of the ‘Bon Iver How To Write Good Songs’ book, Sydney’s **A Fire In The Woods** may not have the best logo around, or indeed the most extravert online presence, but what they lack in commercial nous, is more than compensated for in the beauty of their debut outing, _Tracks In The Snow_.\n\nDelicate vocals and a raspingly clean guitar sound flow expertly into each other, alongside a carefully honed songwriting knack and intricate lyrics. Check it out below, and grab a free download while you can.",
