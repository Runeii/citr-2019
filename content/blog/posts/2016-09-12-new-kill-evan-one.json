  "body": "Love this debut from NY duo **Kill Evan** (Evan Lo and Ashley Bardhan).\n\nThere’s an almost Dilla or Flylo vibe to the production at times, yet all wrapped up with more pop leaning songwriting. In the same way that a whole host of producers drew from Dilla at the turn of the 10’s, it has that really bold yet elegant edge to it, like diving into a cool swimming pool, again and again and again. Check it out below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.\n\n<a href=\"http://killevan.bandcamp.com/album/one\">One. by Kill Evan</a>",
