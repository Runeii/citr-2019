Coming in so many diverse yet oddly synchronized forms, it’s a worn out expression, but there really is something for everyone. However, it’s also true that unfortunately the vast majority of artists experimenting with this newly discovered sound, are from across the pond, and we are somewhat lacking in the UK. However with the ever rising Star Slinger, and this new track from Bradford based producer Hourglass Sea, it shouldn’t be long before we can make our mark on the scene.\n\nL.A. Lights is a futuristic funk affair, sampling R&B hooks, as well as Gameboy like sounds, all moulding together to form something quite intoxicating and utterly enslaving. With live dates expected in the near future, Hourglass Sea will be releasing his debut album next year. Check out L.A. Lights below.\n\n [L.A Lights](http://soundcloud.com/hourglasssea/l-a-lights) by [Hourglass Sea](http://soundcloud.com/hourglasssea)",
