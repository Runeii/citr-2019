  "body": "Love it or hate it, Skins is back on our TV sets.\n\nSo it’s hugely cliched, overly offensive and features some of the worst acting ever seen, but I can’t help having a soft spot for it. Earlier this evening the first episode of series six of the BAFTA award winning drama was premiered on E4, so with CitR being a music website, it makes sense to look back upon the musical offerings used in the show.\n\nOpening moped scene – **Azealia Banks** – _212 (Feat. Lazy Jay)_\n\nThe most hyped track of the past few months was inevitably going to appear on the show at some point, but including it in the opening credits was a bold move. Did it work? Well yeah, just about.\n\nOn the drive to the villa – **The War On Drugs** – _Baby Missiles_\n\nA modern day classic and perfectly fitting to the jovial mood of the scene, an inspired choice.\n\nLounging by the pool – **Hanni El Khatib** – _Build. Destroy. Rebuild._\n\nAnother good choice, although could have used slightly more of the track.\n\nMatty and Frankie arrive – **The Smiths** – _How Soon Is Now?_\n\nSo it appears that Joey Barton has made **The Smiths** cooler than ever, however including How Soon Is Now? wasn’t the best move, and was only made worse by the horrendous **Morrissey** name-drop later in the script.\n\nThe boys have a shower – **H-Kayne** – _Issawa Style_\n\nSoundtracking the ‘funny’ moments is never easy, but this inclusion of a relatively obscure Moroccan rap hit was another fine pick.\n\nRich and Grace on the roof – **King Creosote & Jon Hopkins** – _Your Own Spell_\n\nThe highlight from one of last years most underrated records, this track deserved a far more poignant moment, not helped by the rigid acting.\n\nGrace sings – **Francoise Hardy** – _All Because Of You (performed by Jessica Sula)_\n\nA fantastic song unfortunately ruined by a fairly average cover. I get that they were going for the ‘unique’ and touching element, but this just didn’t work at all.\n\nParty at Luke’s – **Segal** – _Trainjek Nostril_\n\nWorked superbly, and hey, at least it’s not **Skrillex**, right? I bet the cool kids loved the drop.\n\n[Trainjek Nostril (Nostril)](http://soundcloud.com/segal/trainjek-nostril-nostril) by [Segal](http://soundcloud.com/segal)\n\nLuke and Frankie dance – **Nick** – _Morocco’s Festival (Simon & Shaker Teramik Remix)_\n\nAnother dance number, not quite as fitting as the previous track and fell rather flat, in what could have been a scene of high sexual tension.\n\nvar zippywww=\"www41\";var zippyfile=\"82260739\";var zippydown=\"ffffff\";var zippyfront=\"000000\";var zippyback=\"ffffff\";var zippylight=\"000000\";var zippywidth=680;var zippyauto=false;var zippyvol=80;var zippydwnbtn = 1;\n\nThe morning after – **Dark Dark Dark** – _Wild Goose Chase_\n\nA truly beautiful track that again could have been used to more emotionally driven effect. Nonetheless, a stellar inclusion.\n\nRich and Grace on the rooftop – **Sporto Kantès** – _Slits_\n\nAn interesting choice that just about worked, despite the scene in question being a dud.\n\nPoolside – **Icarus** – _Police Academy 6 (Feat. unouomedude)_\n\nGreat to see one of my favourite artists getting high profile recognition, and hopefully the inclusion of this track will open even more people up to the unforgettable music of **unouomedude**.\n\n[Police Academy 6 – Icarus (featuring unouomedude) – 2011](http://soundcloud.com/amdiscs/police-academy-6-icarus) by [AMDISCS](http://soundcloud.com/amdiscs)\n\nBeach Party – **Adeptus** – _Copacliasexicalla_\n\nI don’t believe this track is available to hear on the internet yet, but it fitted in rather nicely, alongside three tracks from [Segal](http://soundcloud.com/segal/) – Look Up, Temper and Forbidden Bells.\n\nLiv finds out Luke is no good – **Tim Hecker** – _Chimeras_\n\nWhat can I say, the man is a legend. Chimeras perfectly matched the mood of the scene.\n\nCar chase – **Venetian Snares** – _Hand Throw_\n\nHeavy and rather fitting for the best scene of the episode.\n\nNick in college – **Scott Matthews** – _Eyes Wider Than Before_\n\nAnother classic, this time used at exactly the right moment.\n\nCheck back next week for another round up of the music used in Episode 2.",
