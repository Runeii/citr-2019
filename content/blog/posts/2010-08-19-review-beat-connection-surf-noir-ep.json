There is no shortage of artists trying to break through in the electronic dream pop genre, however there are few who have can maintain a level of quality control to sustain any form of momentum. With the increased use of synthesisers and electronic equipment, it is becoming easier every day for artists to produce listenable tunes, so it’s even more admirable when a group are be able to produce music that is engrossing and entertaining.\n\n**Beat Connection** released _Surf Noir_ in early July via bandcamp, the latest in a long line of unsigned artists to make their music accessible for all via the site. From the first track there are the obvious **Kraftwerk** influences, although it sounds far from forced, each song offers something completely distinctive and imaginative. _In The Water_ is a mystical, vocal heavy tune, partially carried by the prominent beat and familiar handclaps. Elsewhere, there are steel drums, maracas and pan pipes, showing the duo’s knowledge of a vast range of instrumental values, as well as their compositional skills.\n\nPersonal favourite  _Silver Screen_  is one of my tracks of the year so far, emanating an ethereal quality, showcasing **Koplowitz** and **Juenger** at their spellbinding best. _Same Damn Time_ closes the EP in epic style, simplistic yet charismatic, another standout track on the release. The rhythms are muscular, the melodies are enchanting and most of all, the way in which they are sewn so perfectly together makes _Surf Noir_ an encouraging and clairvoyant listen from a duo who are sure to be on their way to bigger and better things.\n\nCheck back over the next few days for an interview with Beat Connection.\n\n[Check Out Beat Connection’s Myspace!](http://www.myspace.com/beatconnexion)",
