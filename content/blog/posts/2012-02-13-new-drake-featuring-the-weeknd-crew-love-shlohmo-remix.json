  "title": "New: Drake Featuring The Weeknd – Crew Love (Shlohmo Remix)",
  "date": "2012-02-13T01:00:26",
  "body": "It’s been a fairly crazy few days for **Shlohmo**, having had his remix of _Crew Love_ praised by **The Weeknd** himself, he touched it up slightly and has released it with the backing of the two superstar rappers.\n\nWhether it’s as good as the original, I’m not quite sure, but it’s certainly an interesting take, and refreshing to find globally renowned celebrities noticing the work of those still on the rise. Predominantly using **The Weeknd’s** vocals, **Shlohmo’s** remix has a more atmospheric, spacious feel to it, extremely suited to being played at the hippest clubs in the slickest cities.",
