  "body": "Smoke bombs, broken windows, smashed glass, suffocation, burning… all sounds like something from Breaking News right? I can happily inform to you there is no BOMBSITIT over here, but the discovery of the hauntingly transient work from the artist **Pauline Nadal**.\n\nThere is something very tantalising, yet unnerving about a material that is intangible, and it’s this ephemeral feeling that Nadal encapsulates in her films of light and pigmented smoke. The solemn pace and lavering formations that it creates is obviously something she is fascinated by. She plays in derelict spaces to showcase this simple yet effective use of materials.\n\nSmoke typically being a substance riddled in negative connotations, Nadal shows us it can be something of beauty. Her smoke paintings her not really paintings at all; but with film on her side she is making the impossible, possible. Smoke sculpture? Now that’s something I’d like to see.\n\nPauline Nadal will be showing her work alongside the music of LAW in **CiTR Live #002** on the 30th of May.\n\nTo see more of her work, click [HERE](http://www.paulinenadal.com/).\n\nBe sure to not miss the exciting sensory fusions next Thursday.\n\n#gallery-1 { margin: auto; } #gallery-1 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } #gallery-1 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-1 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } /\\* see gallery\\_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php \\*/\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-shot-2013-05-24-at-21.31.14-150x150.png)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22090-artist-profile-pauline-nadal/attachment/screen-shot-2013-05-24-at-21-31-14)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-shot-2013-05-24-at-21.31.46-150x150.png)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22090-artist-profile-pauline-nadal/attachment/screen-shot-2013-05-24-at-21-31-46)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-shot-2013-05-24-at-21.32.491-150x150.png)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22090-artist-profile-pauline-nadal/attachment/screen-shot-2013-05-24-at-21-32-49-2)\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-shot-2013-05-24-at-21.32.161-150x150.png)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22090-artist-profile-pauline-nadal/attachment/screen-shot-2013-05-24-at-21-32-16-2)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-shot-2013-05-24-at-21.34.26-150x150.png)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22090-artist-profile-pauline-nadal/attachment/screen-shot-2013-05-24-at-21-34-26)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-shot-2013-05-24-at-22.01.11-150x150.png)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22090-artist-profile-pauline-nadal/attachment/screen-shot-2013-05-24-at-22-01-11)",
