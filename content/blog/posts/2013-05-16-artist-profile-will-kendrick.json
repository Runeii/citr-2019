  "body": "High and low culture mixed together, died fluorescent and poured into a mould.\n\n‘[Pornaments](http://willkendrick.co.uk/pornaments.html)’ puts a range of kitsch ornaments into shiny, new visceral forms; nudes, next to cats, next to well to do ladies from the turn of the 19th century. The works have a Jeff Koons vibe, without the need to scale them up to ginormous sizes. They nod towards an art historical tradition (Venus) and the origins of taste in antiquities (with something getting lost in the translation from porcelain to plastic- from expensive china plates to gaudy pound-shop ducks). The gloopy sculptures take something tacky and make it physically tackier. [  \n](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/will-kendrick-2.jpg)\n\n#gallery-1 { margin: auto; } #gallery-1 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } #gallery-1 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-1 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } /\\* see gallery\\_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php \\*/\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC01721-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21898-artist-profile-will-kendrick/attachment/_dsc0172-2)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/16.-Shire-Horse-20111-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21898-artist-profile-will-kendrick/attachment/16-shire-horse-2011-2)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC0177-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21898-artist-profile-will-kendrick/attachment/_dsc0177)\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/will-kendrick-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21898-artist-profile-will-kendrick/attachment/will-kendrick)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/will-kendrick-2-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21898-artist-profile-will-kendrick/attachment/will-kendrick-2)\n\n  \n\nColour sensory overload plays a part in most of Kendrick’s work. A nice contrast to the physical paint drips on the ‘Pornaments’- is his video ‘[Data Drip](http://willkendrick.co.uk/datadrip.html)’ -where the pixelated drips slowly glitch their way down the screen.\n\nKendrick is showing his video work at the next [CitR Live](https://www.facebook.com/events/503640323024237/?fref=ts) alongside [Pale](https://soundcloud.com/pale-vv).\n\nTickets are still available [here](http://www.residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?480712).",
