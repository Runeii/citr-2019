  "date": "2014-11-18T09:14:49",
  "body": "OOFJ have an interesting backstory.\n\nThe group are a couple, Jenno Bjørnkjær and Katherine Mills-Rymer, who met while working on Lars Von Trier’s ‘Melancholia’. Their music has been used on a variety of films since then and you can hear that suspense and atmosphere leaking throughout the track.\n\n‘You’re Always Good To Me’ blends sultry, dream-pop influenced vocals beside scattering drums and sweeping strings. The effect is almost hypnotic, the disparate influences coming together to form something otherworldly.\n\nOOFJ are releasing their second album _Acute Feast_ next spring and you can listen to ‘You’re Always Good To Me’ below.",
