  "body": "I’m not entirely sure what it is with Scandinavian music right now, but there are some absolute beauties emerging from Northern Europe.\n\n**Pyke**, a Norwegian duo who cropped up on my radar a couple of weeks back are the latest set to make a serious impression, with the release of their debut album at the beginning of October. A stunning record, that merges elements of Beach House-esque dream pop, with touches of early 90’s shoegaze, it’s a bold and expansive sound that offers up new experiences with every listen. Check out personal highlights _Follow Me_ and _Intimacy II_ below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
