  "body": "Far and away my favourite track from **Washed Out’s** 2011 album **_Within and Without_**, _A Dedication_ is thoroughly deserving of a stunning video, and [**Yoonha Park**](http://www.yoonhapark.com/) has created just that. Echoing the delicate, ballad inspired atmosphere of the track, it’s ever-so cliched yet in an entirely watchable way. So there’s shots of people jumping into lakes, water running down windowpanes and plenty other ‘deep and meaningful’ clips, but c’mon, everyone likes a bit of self-indulgence once in a while.",
