But despite **Leaving Records** releasing this new collaboration as just that – an album – I immediately forgive the short length of material. With this, quality overcomes quantity, as it should always do, and when I mention the name **Matthewdavid**, or mention the word **Brainfeeder**, you know what you’re looking at in terms of quality, right?\n\nRight. **Matthewdavid** (full name Matthew David McQueen) gave us his tense, hazy love letter to Los Angeles earlier this year with _**Outmind**_, and since then (and before), has been messing around on little-known record label (now cassette label), **Leaving Records**. I found out about **Leaving** much earlier in the year when they released the EP by ultimate weirdo beatmaker and insane [Twitter terrorist](http://twitter.com/WANDAGROUP) **Dem Hunger**, which was as incredible as it was surreal. Since then I’ve kept a loose eye on their movements – stuff from **Ras G**, **Johnwayne**, and even **Anticon** head, **Odd Nosdam**. Their releases on **Leaving** seem to all be quite chilled out, experimental and atmospheric, which is strange when it comes to this new combination: LA-based **Matthewdavid** and Chicago’s **Serengeti**.\n\n**Serengeti** is someone I’ve seen somewhere else before but can’t put my finger on him – looking into it I’ve noticed he’s done some stuff with pretty much all underground beatmakers and rappers, including **Buck65**, **DJ Crucial**, **Tobacco** and **MF Grimm**. But if anything, this EP (I’m gonna call it an EP really) shows he’s a confident, conscientious, and down-to-earth voice in underground rap. Apparently, these tracks are merely little flavours put together over the last summer…but **Matthewdavid**‘s talent is used to full potantial, his haunting production pushed to extra-catchy heights to accommodate the vocals, with just enough kick to keep **Serengeti**‘s voice rolling consistently.\n\nWhen I said down-to-earth, I meant it – this guy can drop cringey contemporary mentions of Google and Facebook and hide them tastefully in the lyrical spread. Puns on Jay-Z lyrics, and a short ballad on ‘sexting’ (aptly titled _**Sexting**_) may put some off when they read this sentence, but somehow they’re fresher and more unique than I make them sound. I really hope these two do more than just this EP – this EP having a total running time of 18 minutes. These two together are like a solved Rubick’s cube. With **Serengeti**, McQueen’s beats aren’t distracted by the temptations and potential pitfalls before him – melancholy, abstraction, chillwave. And **Serengeti** has the perfect platform on which to lay his rhymes across with the sparsity and carefulness of McQueen’s productions. I really look forward to another release from these two, hopefully again on **Leaving**, who really are an important label for our generation. Cassette tapes are enjoying a renaissance, and creators of experimental hip-hop – including the recent **Death Grips** – are the perfect bedfellows.\n\n_Listen to a few tunes from **Davis**‘ self titled mini-album below. Out now on cassette and download on **Leaving Records**._\n\n_Better When You Flow_\n\n_Stepson_\n\n_#Nope_",
