  "date": "2013-06-13T15:55:14",
  "body": "I’ve been sitting on this track from Provo’s **Lake Island** for the best part of ten days now, trying to work out 1) whether I actually like it, 2) quite why it is that I like it.\n\nSeveral listens later and I’ve come to the conclusion that 1) I do like it, and that somewhat bizarrely, I’m still unable to answer 2). So it has touches of early **Coldplay** (think Parachutes, Rush of Blood to the Head), yet with tender undertones, marked most pointedly by the imperfect nature of the vocals. Check out _Grindstone_ below, alongside a remix of the so far unheard Wolves, taken from **Lake Island’s** debut LP Outermost, released fall 2013.",
