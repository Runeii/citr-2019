  "body": "It’s three o’clock in the morning, and there’s only one band that could have be up at this absurd time; **Animal Collective**.\n\nEarlier this evening the Brooklyn quartet announced the release of a new 7″ single in the form of _Honeycomb / Gotham_ available for preorder now via [Domino](http://www.dominorecordco.com/honeycomb) on 25 June. Psychedelic and gloriously upbeat, both tracks showcase **Animal Collective** at their utmost best. _Honeycomb_ is an unrelenting, tribal percussion driven number whilst _Gotham_ is a more placid affair, continuing with the dazzling rhythm sections. Check out both tracks below via the nifty little player.",
