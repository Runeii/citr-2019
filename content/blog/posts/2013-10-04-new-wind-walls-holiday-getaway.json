With little information available on **Wind & Walls **(the male member also records under the name [Boy Venus](https://soundcloud.com/boyvenus) … I think…), aside from this track and references to Wild Nothing, The Middle East and John Mayer, it’ll be mightily interesting to see what the duo come up with next.",
