The beat, produced by Heems himself, Patrick Wimberly of Chairlift fame and Miles Benjamin Anthony Robinson, builds with swelling bass sounds, completed with a middle-finger of a hook.\n\nYou can find the link to the original song on [Heems’ tumblr](http://nehrujackets.tumblr.com/post/102873985290/here-is-new-york-produced-by-himanshu-suri) and give it a listen below.\n\nIf ‘New York’ didn’t make it on _Eat Pray Thug_ because it wasn’t good enough, we’re in for a huge treat when the album drops.\n\n[http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Heems-New-York.mp3](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Heems-New-York.mp3)",
