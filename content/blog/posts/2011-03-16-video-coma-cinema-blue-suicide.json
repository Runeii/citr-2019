Williams, well he’s been at it again. This time taking Blue Suicide, the title track and lead single from Coma Cinema’s new record, and backing it with stunning visual effects. Drenched with sepia tones, and portraying a heart breaking story of self inflicted death, it’s another spectacle to watch. Any budding young film makers should be looking to Tyler’s work for inspiration, as he continues to cement himself as one of the most innovative, exciting talents in film at the moment.\n\n[Coma Cinema – Blue Suicide](http://vimeo.com/21051184) from [Tyler T Williams](http://vimeo.com/tylertwilliams) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).\n\nOh and the song itself isn’t half bad either, check back later for a full review of Blue Suicide.",
