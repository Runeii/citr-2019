His eloquent lyrics and handsome vocals display a maturity far beyond his tender age, yet it’s his partially his inexperience that makes _Blood_ such a vividly engaging listen. _‘I like the girls with the blue eyes and the brown stare’_ laments **Smith** with such an admirable honesty, scarcely found in modern music. Entirely acoustic, _Blood_ excels upon it’s minimal albeit all-encompassing feel, drawing the listener in and then breaking their heart. Check out _Blood_ below.",
