  "body": "From the humble beginnings of 2012’s [Female Robbery](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14538-new-the-neighbourhood-female-robbery/), it’s been a whirlwind two years or so for LA five piece **The Neighbourhood**. Sold out tours, unique, ground-breaking appearances on prime-time TV shows and a debut album that broke the top 40 in the US, culminating in the announcement of a new album, titled  [#000000](https://soundcloud.com/tags/000000) & [#FFFFFF](https://soundcloud.com/tags/FFFFFF) (**_The Black And The White_**). Along with the news of a their sophomore LP, they also debuted new track, _Silver_, a real change in direction for the group. Maintaining much of the slick, R&B production values that initially shot them to fame, there’s an insatiable hunger and maturity to _Silver_; it’s a track that’s tearing down boundaries and placing limitless potential in their own hands. Check it out below, and catch them supporting **The 1975** at a bunch of UK shows next year.",
