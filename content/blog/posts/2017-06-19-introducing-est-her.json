  "body": "**Est-Her’s** stunning first track is without a doubt the most strikingly ambitious debut single I’ve heard this year.\n\nThe former ballet dancer goes straight for the jugular on the daringly over-the-top _Sympathy_, with his raw vocal dominating the track in spectacular style. This is almost how I’d imagine Ellery’s (WU LYF) career to pan out after the Mancunian outfit split up – it’s confidently cinematic yet searingly heartfelt and marks out the Toronto artist as a true talent. Check out Sympathy below.\n\n_call yourself a saint / but you’ll always be a liar_",
