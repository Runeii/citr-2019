As well as announcing a string of US dates including a sure to be animated show at Coachella, Tyler the Creator of OFWGKTA fame has dropped his take on Lykke Li’s new single I Follow Rivers.\n\nSlowing it down and adding a couple of verses of his own, whilst maintaining the original hook, it’s far from the pop track Lykke Li had intended it to be. His stereotypical crude lyricism is startling obvious, a trait he may have to tone down for his appearance on the Jimmy Fallon Show next week. Tyler’s remix is a available as a free download from below.\n\n[Lykke Li – I Follow Rivers (Tyler the Creator Mix)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/4571-new-lykke-li-i-follow-rivers-tyler-the-creator-mix/attachment/lykke-li-i-follow-rivers-tyler-the-creator-mix)",
