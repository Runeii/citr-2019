Just because.  The stand out track though is Best Coast and Wavves collaboration on ‘Something For You’, replete with sleigh bells galore. It is simply a nice, comfortable, lo-fi ode to the festive season, with duel vocals by Bethany Cosentino and Nathan Williams; the fact that they’re currently dating explains the innocent, yet inclusive chemistry between the pair.  It is a genuinely good song, exclusive of any seasonal motive, and is a bitch for getting stuck in your head, with the harmonised falsetto of the two giving the track a 60s, Beach Boys edge, perfect for keeping warm in the snow.\n\nFinally, The Futureheads have released a fantastically original and yet oddly familiar Christmas single- [‘Christmas Was Better In The 80s’.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHNpS-pnH-M) It has acapella carolling, hallelujahs and a singalong chorus.  You could literally not ask for more; there is even an introductory piano accompaniment, before the classic rock guitar hook kicks in.  This isn’t a song that relaxes, the melody is consistently altered to encapsulate the traits that the band feel a Christmas hit should have, and as a result sounds like every festive song you’ve ever enjoyed, but with a geordie twist.",
