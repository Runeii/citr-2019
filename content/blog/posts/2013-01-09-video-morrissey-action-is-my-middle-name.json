  "body": "To kick off the US leg of his current world tour, Morrissey popped up on Letterman to debut a track off his upcoming.\n\nDespite being touted by some publications as a new track, it’s _Action is my middle name_, a tune that’s been kicking around the live/bootleg circuit since….well, it was already around back when I still gave a shit about Morrissey.\n\nIf you’re of the camp that Morrissey has phoned it in since The Smiths // Vauxhall & I // birth // conception then this will do nothing to change your mind.  After all, it’s all there: the crooning, the (nowadays half-arsed) sexual metaphors, the nagging sense it’s become a bit club-singer-doing-glam-rock.\n\nHowever, if you’re of the camp that he’s been good consistently // since his comeback // up until Years of Refusal, then there might be something here for you. I mean, it’s not disturbing the formula that’s kept his adoring fans entertained for decades and it definitely beats his last Letterman debut (the abysmal, screeching _That’s How People Grow Up)._\n\nBut then, _Suedehead_ was 25 years ago and even _You Are the Quarry_ is approaching a decade. It’d take a special kind of obsession to fall for the same formula, minus the riffs and genuine wit, in 2013.\n\nhttpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQAKetuk\\_Yc",
