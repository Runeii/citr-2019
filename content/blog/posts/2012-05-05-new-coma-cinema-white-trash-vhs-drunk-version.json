  "body": "**NB: Not actual artwork**\n\n**Coma Cinema’s** fourth LP entitled _**School Shootings**_ is far and away my most anticipated release of 2012.\n\nLast year’s **_Blue Suicide_** quite rightly cemented **Mat Cothran’s** position as one of the finest songwriters around, and quite how he isn’t being hounded by industry A&R’s I’ll never know. This new demo taken from said forthcoming album is described as **Cothran** as being _‘about the time I was almost murdered and every thing that happened because of that’._ Record whilst in a state of intoxication, it’s everything we’ve grown to love from **Coma Cinema**; raw, emotional and scarily real. Check out _White Trash VHS_ below and the tracklisting for _**School Shootings**_ under that.\n\n*   White Trash VHS\n*   School Shootings\n*   Warm Wolves Milking Mary\n*   Survivor’s Guilt\n*   Partners In Crime\n*   Virgin Veins\n*   Leaking House\n*   Hurt Everything\n*   Hotter Sadness\n*   Lee\n*   Columbine High Harmony",
