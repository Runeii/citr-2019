Well that obscure little night I spoke of last time isn’t quite so small anymore; the obscurity however, it seems is here to stay. The now regular event has begun to draw huge crowds under the infamous [**Tyne Bar**](http://www.facebook.com/jchima?v=wall&story_fbid=141374629228732&ref=notif&notif_t=feed_comment#!/thetynebar?ref=ts) arches; from artists to music lovers, the event has managed to cater for everyone thanks partly to a new ‘live drawing’ feature that truly adds something completely different to what you’ll see at a ‘standard’ club night.\n\nWith the summer coming to an end however, unfortunately so are the sketches parties; but fret not music lovers (yes I know I sound like a wanker), **Sketches** is back for one last party at the **Tyne** on Friday. This time local producer **Psychonaught** takes to the decks along with the **Sketches** residents, for one last dance before Sketches is forced to find a new home for the colder months. Below are some tunes from both the residents and [**Psychonaught**](http://www.myspace.com/unwino) himself, enjoy and I’ll see you from 6.30 on Friday.\n\n[Facebook Event](http://www.facebook.com/home.php?ref=logo#!/event.php?eid=104452559612724&ref=ts)\n\n [Psychonaught – Tell Me](http://soundcloud.com/psychonaught/psychonaught-tell-me) by [Psychonaught](http://soundcloud.com/psychonaught)\n\n [Edmondson – Eighty Seven](http://soundcloud.com/edmondson/edmondson-eighty-seven) by [Edmondson](http://soundcloud.com/edmondson)\n\n [No time for change](http://soundcloud.com/veshch/no-time-for-change) by [Veshch](http://soundcloud.com/veshch)\n\n[‘Like’ Sketches on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/home.php?ref=logo#!/event.php?eid=104452559612724&ref=ts)",
