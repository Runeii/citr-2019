  "body": "It’s been a while since we heard from duo **Rachel Zeffira** and **Faris Badwan** aka **Cat’s Eyes**.\n\nDespite receiving rave reviews, their self-titled debut album released earlier this year went somewhat under-appreciated, bringing in fairly poor sales figures. This new video for _The Best Person I Know_, one of the albums highlights, is gorgeously shot and startlingly vibrant, mirroring the downbeat twee feel to the track. Inspiration for the video came from **Ron Arad**, with the artist/architect allowing the duo to use a silicon curtain he created as an installation prototype. As the curtain sways and the projected images begin to fragment, reality is well and truly left behind, with the viewer entering into a fantastical imaginary world. Check out the video for _The Best Person I Know_ underneath.",
