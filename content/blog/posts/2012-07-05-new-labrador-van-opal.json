  "date": "2012-07-05T23:52:29",
  "body": "**Labrador Van**, a four piece from Vancouver show heaps of potential on new track, _Opal_.\n\nA gritty two and a half minute number, drawing from the likes of **Wavves** yet with a more lovelorn attitude, it almost feels like an album opener, building the foundations for greater things to come. As the song crescendo’s in a mess of extravagant drums and scratchy guitar lines, it finishes, leaving the tantalizing feeling of forever craving more. Check out _Opal_ below.",
