Whilst it doesn’t hark back to their acoustically raw roots, it’s still an enjoyable listen and a positive sign for what’s to come. Since 2003’s hit record Transatlanticism, Death Cab have been become a staple component of the American indie pop charts, and You Are A Tourist is sure to put them right back in the public eye again.\n\n[Death Cab For Cutie – You Are A Tourist](http://soundcloud.com/listenbeforeyoubuy/death-cab-for-cutie-you-are-a) by [ListenBeforeYouBuy](http://soundcloud.com/listenbeforeyoubuy)",
