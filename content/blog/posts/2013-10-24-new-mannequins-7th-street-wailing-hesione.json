  "date": "2013-10-24T00:23:20",
  "body": "Belgium via London duo **Mannequins on 7th Street** don’t exactly give much away in their photos, with the above grainy image showing two fairly indistinguishable young males playing to a crowd of a few dozen people.\n\nTheir debut track, the rather fantastic _Wailing Of Hesoine_ (Hesoine being a figure from Greek mythology, I believe), is a sort of SOHN meets The XX style number. Minimal, understated, yet beauteous in all the right moments, finding solace in the sparse beat and gorgeous lyricism. Early days but I’ve no doubt this will turn many heads; **Mannequins on 7th Street** are a mightily exciting prospect.",
