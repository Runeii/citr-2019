  "body": "**Yunō** is the side project of summer anthem virtuoso **Unouomedude** and witnesses him exploring a more psychedelic aspect to his creational output.\n\nDebut track _Disney World_ is solely instrumental, and attempts to recreate a repetitive dream experienced by the protagonist. Comprised largely of sampled vocals and looped synths, **Yunō** constructs a lucid yet ambiguous world within which the track gyrates. Download _Disney World_ below and keep an eye out for future releases.",
