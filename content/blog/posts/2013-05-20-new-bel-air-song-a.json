  "body": "I’m such a sucker for the crisp, almost sorrowful guitar sound that **Bel Air** absolutely nail on their debut track, simply titled _Song A_.\n\nRecorded by Michael Belsar from Victoria outfit **Hunting Grounds**, it’s melancholic, remorseful and desperately beautiful. So the home recording leaves the vocals slightly rough at times, but it’s all the more haunting, especially when coupled with the lyrics _‘I was never told my name, but what does it even say?_‘. One of the finest debut tracks of 2013.",
