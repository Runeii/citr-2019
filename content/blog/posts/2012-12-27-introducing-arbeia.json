  "body": "As every year comes to a close, music seems to roll in at an almost unmanageable pace, almost as if bands and artists know that I’m in no fit state to post anything.\n\nIndie band, **[Arbeia](https://soundcloud.com/arbeia)** are interesting to me for one main reason. They’re from South Shields, a town very close to the area I grew up in. Now this isn’t perhaps interesting to anyone who isn’t from the area, but to those who are, it’s actually rather poignant. South Shields is a wasteland; baron, empty and sad. Despite its proximity to the bright lights of Newcastle, people who grow up there find it very difficult to leave. **Arbeia**’s music however has already left; it’s vast in its undertakings and at times delicate in its findings. It’s music that isn’t made for one particular type of person or space, it fills a universal space that makes it such a joy to listen to. Sure it’s rough around the edges at times, but they’ve only been around for 3 months, time will hopefully smooth their sound out.",
