  "body": "Maaaaan, **Eyedress** has come a long way since he was first on our pages.\n\nHis music once had the distinct allure of bedroom pop music, which wasn’t a bad thing of course, we wrote about him for a fairly sustained period of time, but his fleeting attitude to genre combined with his prolific output definitely demanded some focus. _Nature trips_, the new track taken from his upcoming **Abeano** release, is a smart step in the right direction. The creeping synth focused jam is remarkably assured in scope and its story more believable in tone. Despite his music sounding more, for want of a better word, expensive, it still retains the untrained/self taught quality that brought me into the arms of his music in the first place.\n\n_The ‘Supernatural’ EP drops on the 2nd December 2013 via **Abeano.**_",
