  "body": "![](http://audiomilk.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/2.jpg \"Youth Lagoon\")This glorious lo-fi debut track from Youth Lagoon has already climbed it’s way into being one of my favourite tracks from this year so far, despite it only being around for just over a day. The first minute and a half of July consist of muttered vocals and reverb laden feedback, before the song erupts majestically. A gently played xylophone and a steady drum beat ground the track, whilst the vocals strain elegantly, fitting the mood of the song perfectly. With just this one song, the forthcoming debut album The Year Of Hibernation is now one of my most anticipated of the year. Check out July below.\n\n [July](http://soundcloud.com/youth-lagoon/july) by [Youth Lagoon](http://soundcloud.com/youth-lagoon)",
