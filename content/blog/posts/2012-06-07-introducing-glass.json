  "body": "Featuring two former members of the criminally underrated **Morning Runner** (perhaps best known from the theme tune of The Inbetweeners), **GLASS** step it up a gear with their atmospheric prog-pop.\n\nTheir five debut tracks are characterised by the distinctive vocals of **Matthew Greener** and their alluring stadium rock sensibilities, switching effortlessly between synth heavy numbers (_Signs And Wonders_) and the more refined, **Muse**\\-esque track _Everything Belongs_.\n\nAs with **Morning Runner**, **GLASS** display a wondrous ability to perfect a winning song writing formula, however whether they have the breakthrough single will remain to be seen. Having been hindered first time around by overzealous label ambitions and the callous nature of the industry, these tracks certainly deserve attention, whether that be critical or commercial. Check out all five of their debut tracks below.",
