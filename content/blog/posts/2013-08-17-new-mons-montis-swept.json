  "body": "Every now and then, in between Chinese school kids covering Ed Sheeran or hilariously bad remixes of Lady Gaga, Soundcloud’s Explore section can bring up the odd gem or two.\n\nThis debut track from Sweden’s **Mons Montis**, titled _Swept_ (originally called _Dynamite_) is exactly why the world is increasingly falling in love with Scandi-pop (a title I have a feeling that Mons Montis probably detest). There’s little information available online, except the names of the band members; Viktor Paulsrud, Herman Båverud Olsson and Julia Hjertström and the fact that they’re from Uppsala . Gorgeous female vocals and an addictive synth-hook, this trio are well worth four minutes of your time.",
