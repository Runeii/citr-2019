  "body": "One of the real winners of this years Great Escape Festival was Norwegian teenager **AURORA**, with rave reviews coming in for both her afternoon acoustic set, and her full band backed evening performance.\n\nAside from having one of the finest voices around, there’s something bewitching about her mannerisms as she performs, as witnessed in this live cover of Nat King Cole’s _Nature Boy_. Verging upon intimidating, it’s atmospheric on a whole new level, and demonstrates even further the colossal potential that AURORA has.\n\nFollow our [Spotify On Repeat playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a hand-picked selection of the current hottest tracks.",
