Halo debuts what is seemingly a more outwardly evident pop orientated direction, whilst maintaining the dream-like principles that last years Summer Heart LP was based upon. The vocals are more poignant and emphasized, alongside a muscular beat, primarily composed of hand claps and tambourines. All in all, a fantastic indicator for what is to come from this impressive young artist. If you’re heading to SXSW next week, then be sure to catch Blackbird Blackbird at the Bond Music Group showcase, alongside Teen Daze and a DJ set from Moby. Also check out Halo below and download if you wish!\n\n [Halo](http://soundcloud.com/blckbrdblckbrd/halo) by [blackbird blackbird](http://soundcloud.com/blckbrdblckbrd)",
