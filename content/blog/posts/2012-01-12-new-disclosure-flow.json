As club bangers go, ‘**_Flow_**’ is up there with the very best. The whole thing oscillates to the thumping and jerking rhythm, the thick synth work slotting perfectly to the dubstep infused beat. What elevates the track however are the vocals, the purity of the message, “get on the floor”, combined with the smoothness of the voice itself blends all the sounds and textures into a universal delight.\n\n**This Friday’s Church line-up**\n\n**BODDIKA (Swamp81)**\n\n**SYNKRO**\n\n**DISCLOSURE**\n\n**IFAN DAFYDD**\n\n**JUK JUK**\n\n**DAMU**\n\nGrab your tickets **[here.](http://www.residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?313009)**",
