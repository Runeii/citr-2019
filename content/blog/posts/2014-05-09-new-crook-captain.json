  "body": "This vocal from Irish singer / songwriter **Crook** really grabs me.\n\nSo there’s no shortage of ‘acoustic guitarists’ penning four minute, folk indebted odes to lost-lovers, yet judging by his debut outing, Captain, there could be something more to him. Part Elliott Smith, part A. A. Bondy, it’s delicately composed; certainly one of the most moving tracks I’ve heard this week. Check out _Captain_ below, taken from an EP out next week.",
