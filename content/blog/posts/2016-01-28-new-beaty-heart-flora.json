  "date": "2016-01-28T13:27:47",
  "body": "Following on from their striking debut album ‘Mixed Blessings’, Beaty Heart have returned in superb form with their new single ‘Flora’.\n\nChanneling a multitude of instruments and sounds in just over three minutes, ‘Flora’ is a glitchy, sparkling piece of pop. A definite grower as it wraps around your mind’s ear, the track is best described by the band themselves;\n\n‘_Flora’ was partly inspired by the Brazilian jazz singer, Flora Purim. We tried to evoke her rich, steamy tones within our own style, as well as exploring improvisational techniques to form the melody of the song. _\n\n_There’s a real analogue-y, stacatto energy to it that we all love, as well as just a dash of filthy bastard. We also incorporated a vocal sample from ‘Bad Bad Boys’, a 90s Swedish rap hit by Midi, Maxi & Efti, heard during a Robyn DJ set in Stockholm, which we thought was sassy’._\n\nYou can catch Beaty Heart live, along with Makeness in support, on the 13th April at the Electrowerkz in London.",
