  "body": "Oregon duo **W∆NR** impressed with their debut track, the slick, R&B influenced jam _Can’t Get Money_, and have now returned with their full debut EP, titled **_Cityscapes_**.\n\nMore indie-pop orientated than their initial outing would indicate, it’s a subtly brilliant listen, from the **Washed Out**\\-esque vibes of the title track to the tribal percussion led rumble of _Barriers_. Whilst numerous artist appear able to impress blogs with their premiere releases, its takes more than that to build any form of career out of it, and on this EP **W∆NR** show that they have more than enough about them to create a level of sustainability. Check out the full EP below, especially the soulful standout track _The Finest Things_ feat. back-up vocals from **Ana Marcu**, then download it on a [name your price](http://wnrmusic.bandcamp.com/album/cityscape-ep) deal. Oh, and tell a friend.",
