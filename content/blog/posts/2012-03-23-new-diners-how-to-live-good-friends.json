  "body": "Despite hailing from Phoenix, Arizona, there’s something noticeably British about ‘adult pop’ three piece **Diners**.\n\nSure, they’ve got the slightly twee American accents and **Vampire Weekend** inspired jagged guitar lines, yet there’s a jovial grounding to **Diners** that is fairly apparent in their music, despite there only being four minutes of it so far. Both tracks are rather frantic, energetic numbers, not taking themselves too seriously, whilst showing their ability to write catchy two minute pop songs. _Good Friends_ showcases the **Tokyo Police Club**\\-esque slick vocals, with lead singer **Tyler Broderick** recounting _‘oh I live for the stories that you tell, I live for these nights oh I live for hell’._ Check out both tracks below.\n\n<a href=\"http://diners.bandcamp.com/album/songs-from-throw-me-a-10\">Songs from &quot;Throw Me a 10&quot; by Diners</a>",
