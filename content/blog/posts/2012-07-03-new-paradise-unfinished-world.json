  "body": "Far and away the roughest track you’ll hear this year, **Unfinished World** from Vancouver’s **Paradise** isn’t so much as scruffy round the edges as completely and utterly chaotic, yet it’s bloody brilliant.\n\nForcing itself in somewhere between **Interpol** and **Joy Division**, it’s an erratic, (presumably) live recording, relying upon the venomous vocals and organised chaos of the track. So it’s not going to explode into the charts, and it most likely won’t feature on many other blogs in such a raw form, but heck, what a start, and as the closing words of the track tell you – “_you fucking killed it_“.",
