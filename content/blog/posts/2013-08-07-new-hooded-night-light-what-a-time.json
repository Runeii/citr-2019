  "body": "**Hooded**, a new project out of San Francisco, almost sounds like how Oliver Sim (The XX) would, if he went solo.\n\nThe sparse beats, gently picked guitar playing and gradual blossoming of his debut track, _Night Light (What A Time)_ undoubtedly bare some resemblance’s to the The XX, yet chiselling out it’s own niche. With this currently the only material available online by Hooded, it’ll be mightily interesting to watch where he develops from here.",
