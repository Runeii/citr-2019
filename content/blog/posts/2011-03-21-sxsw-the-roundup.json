Unfortunately however, as we’re all shining members of the community, we were all busy studying away at our respective universities. Despite our lack of actually being there, it doesn’t mean we can’t revel in what was no doubt a killer event. So with that we present to you our round up SXSW 2011. It’ll be just like being there, we promise.\n\n**Kurt Vile**\n\n**Odd Future**\n\n**Twin Shadow**\n\n  \n\n**\n\n**Gold Panda**\n\n**Toro Y Moi**\n\n**James Blake**\n\n**Das Racist**\n\n**The Strokes**\n\n**",
