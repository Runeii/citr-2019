  "body": "This debut solo track from LA’s **Esbie Fonte** has really grown on me since hearing it a couple of weeks back.\n\nThere’s definitely elements of recent Norwegian success story Aurora to the vocals, and the songwriting almost feels like it finds it’s roots in folk music – poignant and delicately touching. Check out _Yesterday’s News_ below, both the rather tender video, and the Soundcloud embed.\n\nLike this?
