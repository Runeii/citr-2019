  "body": "Having wowed with the impressive [_**Leaflings**_](http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/leaflings-ep/id528928007) EP last year, Oxfordshire quartet [**Glass Animals**](http://glass-animals.tumblr.com/) kicked it up a gear with _Black Mambo_, attracting a phenomenal interest on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/glassanimals) and Hype Machine. Merging billowing hip-hop inspired beats with a murky, mysterious pop sensibility, it’s seductive, enthralling and undoubtedly one of the singles of 2013 thus far. Set for release on Paul Epworth’s very own Wolf Tone label, we’re delighted to present the UK premiere of the stunning visuals to accompany Black Mambo. Verging upon psychotic, it’s a disturbingly brilliant video, and yet another sign of an immensely talented, and adventurous group.\n\nCheck out the Harry Reavley directed video below, and a host of EU shows after the jump.\n\nJUNE  \nWed 5 – Berghain, Berlin  \nWed 19 – Electrowerkz, London  \nThu 20 – Louisiana, Bristol  \nFri 21 – Trof Fallowfield, Manchester\n\nJULY  \nThu 18 – Melt! Festival, Ferropolis\n\nAUGUST  \nFri 2 – Off Festival, Poland",
