  "body": "Now, this is pretty special.\n\nWith numerous big budget, high profile releases so far this year, it speaks volumes that this debut EP from New York’s **WHATEVER, DAD** blows all of them out of the water. The solo project of 18 year old ‘**E L A I Z A**‘, her recent six track outing is quite possibly the most appealing, immersing new music you’ll hear this year. Forgive me if I’m waffling slightly, but I’m truly that excited.\n\nFrom scouring **E L A I Z A’s** [Audioboo](http://audioboo.fm/elaizasantoast) account and [various blogs](http://www.thisisnotapoop.blogspot.co.uk/), it’s clear that she has a healthy/unhealthy obsession with many of the greats; **Jeff Mangum**, **Talking Heads** and **Vera Lynn** amongst other, alongside a completely unique (some might read pretentious, not me) vision of the world around her. It’s these quirky characteristics and stellar influences that have shaped her music, chiseling her self-titled release into a deeply personal yet engaging listen. The likes of _B U B B L E G U M S H R I N E_ and _W A R S H_ are entirely acoustic numbers, relying on **E L A I Z A’s** 1960’s styled vocals and and intelligent lyricism.\n\nWhilst I’m wary of drawing this comparison, there’s an element of **Lana Del Rey** amongst the refined vocals, yet the unpolished instrumentation is a startling contrast, ultimately coming across far more like **Charlotte Gainsbourg** than the pouty lipped popstar. In the latter half of the release, the tracks gain a **Neutral Milk Hotel**\\-esque confidence, most notably on my personal favourite _✩☀♡ séquence de rêve ♡☀✩_ coupled with sublime lyricism – _‘holding her_ _pachyderms, memories, bled back to me, books from a previous, dream warned violent’_. _A P P L E P E E L S_, sung entirely in French wouldn’t seem out of place in a 1960’s Parisian romantic thriller and closer _R E S T S T O P_, coincidentally almost twice the length of any other track is an ode to the real woman, scorning the futile and fickle tendencies of others. I can guarantee now that **WHATEVER, DAD** will not be to everyone’s taste, however that’s not going to stop me falling head over heels.\n\nCheck out a couple of my favourites and grab a free download of the full release from **WHATEVER, DAD’s** [bandcamp](http://whateverdad.bandcamp.com/).",
