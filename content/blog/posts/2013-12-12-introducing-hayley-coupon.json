  "body": "The best music is timeless: it sounds great now, it would’ve sounded great 40 years ago, and in 20 years, you know you’ll be able to find the 7-inch lost in the bottom of a box in your parents house, and it’s still going to sound great.\n\nIt’s genre-less, emotional, and you’ll never forget it. As soon as you hear it, you fall in love with music all over again.\n\nUpon hearing [Hayley Coupon](https://www.facebook.com/hayleycouponmusic?fref=ts)‘s ‘Pendulum’, this is how I felt. This is a songwriter at her most vulnerable, crooning her way through a soft melody, and leaving her heart on the floor. There’s no fancy effects, no attempt to make something innovative or ‘out of the box’. She just sings, pours her heart to you, and hopes that you accept it.  ‘Let Me Be’ has a similar effect, and reinforces the comparisons I’d make between Hayley and songwriters like Carole King and Joni Mitchell.\n\nThe New York City songwriter released her debut EP ‘Remembrance’ earlier this year, which you can listen to on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/hayley-coupon/sets/remembrance). I hope you feel the beauty in this as much as I do.\n\n\\[soundcloud https://soundcloud.com/hayley-coupon/pendulum\\]\n\n\\[soundcloud https://soundcloud.com/hayley-coupon/letmebe\\]",
