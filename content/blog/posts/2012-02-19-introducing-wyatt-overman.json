  "body": "I’d be lying if I said that I listen to a lot of folk music.\n\nIt’s a genre that I’ve never really delved too deeply into, however these three debut tracks from Minneapolis singer/songwriter **Wyatt Overman** may just have me reconsidering expanding on my knowledge of similar music. Part of the attraction to **Wyatt Overman**, is his sonic similarities to **Kim Janssen**; one of my favourite acoustic artists of the past few years. There’s the gentle flutter of _Children_ and the denser, piano accompanied hum of _Loom_, yet opening track _Islands_ stands head and shoulders above the other two, not that they are poor by any means. It’s a simple song yet containing such undying beauty in it’s three minute length, with the line ‘we built our fires as tall as trees, I fell in love with the back of your knees’ being the ultimate declaration of love. Stream all three tracks below.\n\nNB: Not actual artwork",
