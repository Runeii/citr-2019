  "body": "Hailing from London and composed of **Chris Hardy** and **Greg Ullyart**, [**Night Flowers**](http://www.facebook.com/wearenightflowers) describe themselves as _‘the product of two men… \\[with\\] some ideas and an eight track recorder’_, which seems like a pretty decent albeit humble starting point to me. Drafting in friends and relatives for their debut EP _**Beginnings**_, they create a sound that is both refreshingly varied and instantaneously enjoyable. Opener _Neverlands_ is a shoegaze inspired number, with touches of **Ride** and **Slowdive** amongst the acoustic guitars and reverb laden vocals. Whilst it’s clear that **Night Flowers** are far from the finished product, this collection of tracks if one of the most accomplished debut outings I’ve heard in a long time, with the stunning _Dials_ standing out as a particular highlight.\n\nModest and refined, the repeated refrain _“I don’t sleep well anymore_” is delivered with immaculate and considered resplendence, elevating the track beyond the realms of being simply another lo-fi meets shoegaze revival affair. Check out the video for _Dials_ below, directed by **Ryan Haysom**, and grab the full EP underneath that.\n\n[Night Flowers “DIALS” official music video](http://vimeo.com/38257295) from [Night Flowers](http://vimeo.com/nightflowers) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
