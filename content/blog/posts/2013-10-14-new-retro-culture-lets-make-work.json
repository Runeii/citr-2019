  "body": "Australian disco maestro **Retro Culture** keeps impressing on new cut _Let’s Make It Work_.\n\nToning down the Daft Punk, house music referencing synths, and toying with spliced vocal samples instead, it’s another impressive foot forward for the young musician. In truth, it has more in common with the likes of Neon Indian and Washed Out, than the house inspired numbers that we’re used to from Retro Culture. Check out Let’s Make It Work below.",
