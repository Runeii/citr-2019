  "body": "_‘I want to live in lou reed’s unkempt hair’_ states **Memory Fossils** on his bandcamp page.\n\nA fairly understandable if not slightly bizarre sentiment if I’m being perfectly honest. There’s not quite the slickness nor the art rock vibe that **Reed** manages to instill, however **Memory Fossils** debut release entitled **_Brumous Boys_** is an accomplished collection of lo-fi gems. _On Anatomies At Night_ is as twee and desirably honest sounding as anything **Real Estate** have ever written, never mind being insanely catchy.\n\nElsewhere on the release there’s the delightful drawl of _Albert Camus, What Do You Do When I’m Not Around?_ and the fuzz drained hum of _Lou Reed’s Tiny Echoes_, sounding like a major label big budget artist attempting to record an album that sounds more modest than the financial backing would suggest. Nine tracks in total, most coming in at under two minutes, you know what you’re getting with **Memory Fossils**, gritty, slightly downtrodden sounding declarations of love, hate and disillusionment, and boy, isn’t it just brilliant?\n\nCheck out a couple of tracks within this article, and head over to the **Memory Fossils** [bandcamp](http://memoryfossils.bandcamp.com/) to grab the full release.",
