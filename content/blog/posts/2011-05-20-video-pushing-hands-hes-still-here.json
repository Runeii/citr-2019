Coming in somewhere between Manchester odd-pop darlings Wu Lyf, and jangly guitar group The Maccabees, it’s a brilliant introduction to the band. It’s no surprise to learn that Pushing Hands are close friends with Yuck/Oupa, as well as there being comments on their [soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/freddiewebb) page from Bombay Bicycle Club lead man Jack Steadman. This video for He’s Still Here is complex and slightly unnerving affair; flashing black and white images, accompanied by isolated, aggrieved looking figures. Check out the video below.\n\n[Pushing Hands – He’s Still Here](http://vimeo.com/23765288) from [Matt Ritson](http://vimeo.com/mritson) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
