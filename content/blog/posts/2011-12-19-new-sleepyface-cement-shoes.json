  "body": "If you hadn’t already twigged, I love a bit of downbeat, from-the-bedroom sounding lo-fi.\n\nThis new track from New Jersey’s **Sleepyface** is entirely that, rough round the edges but all the more elegant for it. Combining the raw intimacy of **Casiotone For The Painfully** alone, with a twinge of autotune, _Cement Shoes_ demands repeated listens. Despite it’s minimal approach, there’s far more to the track than is initially revealed, with it bordering the line between being A-list indie playlist and a sumptuous out and out pop anthem. Check out _Cement Shoes_ below.\n\n [Cement Shoes](http://soundcloud.com/sleepyface/cement-shoes) by [Sleepyface](http://soundcloud.com/sleepyface)",
