  "body": "Vancouver’s Syre, whose identity is currently unknown, is brutally honest about his/her creative process, stating on their Soundcloud –  “i make weird music while i watch netflix at 4am”.\n\nTheir three tracks so far, Only You, Fragment and personal favourite Mismatch, are wonderfully colourful journeys through instrumental hip-hop and more modern electronica. Take the aforementioned Mismatch, which fuses half-heard snippets of vocals with delirious synth sections, resulting in something rather bewitchingly beautiful. Check out all three of Syre’s tracks below.",
