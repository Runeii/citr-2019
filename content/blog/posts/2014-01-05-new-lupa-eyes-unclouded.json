Keeping up to date with her Facebook page, she regularly posts new music that she’s discovered, the likes of FKA Twigs, Alpine and Laurel; and what’s even more interesting is hearing it translate into her own music. New track _Eyes Unclouded_ is far and away her most ‘complete’ work to date, a swirling, almost Kate Bush-esque number, showing a lyrical maturity far beyond her modest years.",
