  "body": "Just over six months ago I was sent a handful of tracks composed by **Yuck** frontman **Daniel Blumberg**.\n\nNot being a particularly huge fan of the brash, grating sound created by the London four piece, it was with considerable caution that I approached **_The Weakend EP_**, tagged under the artist name **Yu(c)k**. By the end of opening track _Daughter_, I was already well and truly sold.\n\nGone are the vivacious guitars and shameless **Sonic Youth** impressions, instead replaced by elegant piano sections and **Blumberg’s** heavenly vocals. Now going under the name **Oupa**, new seven track release **_Forget_** continues in a similar vein, emotionally haunting and movingly poignant. The title track which was made available around the same time as the original EP is blissfully self-aware and enchantingly regretfully. The vocal delivery and productions hark back to **Bon Iver’s _For Emma, For Ever Ago_**, constantly altering in intonation and pitch, allowing the track to flow seamlessly. **Blumberg** almost weeps _‘I’ll be natural, no you can’t forget me now’_, it would take an extremely cold heart to deny the sincerity in **Oupa’s** work.\n\n<a href=\"http://boiledegg.bandcamp.com/track/forget\">Forget by Oupa</a>\n\nAs an entirety, the release is dominated by melancholic piano sections, verging upon driving _**Forget**_ into emotional overload, however there is enough variation in the songwriting to prevent this becoming an inevitability. Opener _Driving_ is drenched in searingly honest regret; _‘I have never seen a face, that hit me so hard, with all it’s grace’_, bemoans **Blumberg** joylessly. Those whom have been following the progress of **_CitR_** favourite **Youth Lagoon**, will be able to hear the comparisons, namely in the wistful tone of the music.  Both excel in transferring emotional complexities from the fragmented mind to musical composition, whilst maintaining a relatable, scrupulous appreciation  for the listener.\n\n_New Home_ feels like **Bowie** performing **Beatles** tracks whilst on antidepressants; epic, honorable and truly veracious, one of the finest tracks Blumberg has written to date. Closing track **Those Are The Senses** is the most enduring of them all, coming in at just under eleven minutes, and featuring the song writing skills of **Daniel’s** brother **Saul**. A repetitive guitar section underpins the entire track, during which the vocal driven tension builds gradually to a divinely emotive, heart-breaking crescendo. Having never bought into **Yuck’s** music, it’s increasingly refreshing to hear a band member craft a work of art so utterly beautiful and startlingly different; staking a claim for the most transcendent release of the year. **Forget** is available on cassette and download via **Boiled Egg**, from [here](http://boiledegg.bandcamp.com/album/forget).",
