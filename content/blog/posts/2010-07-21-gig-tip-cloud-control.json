On first listening **Cloud Control** sounds remarkably similar to **Clap Your Hands Say Yeah,** which in itself is an achievement, but listening further their music stand completely alone. With upbeat melodies and lyrics their gigs in the UK are a rare treat and are definitely worth going to see for yourself why they are dubbed ‘Australia’s next big thing’.\n\n Tomorrow night they are playing The Luminaire in Kilburn, London, at 9.00pm with tickets cost £10 with support from King Charles who are due on at 8.15pm.\n\n[Check out their Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/cloudcontrol)",
