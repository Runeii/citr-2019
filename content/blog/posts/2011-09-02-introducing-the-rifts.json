  "body": "Bandcamp is a cruel mistress, as she teases you with rare occasions of an undiscovered talent, though more often than not she simply serves you up a plentiful portion of despair in what many people consider worth sharing with the world.\n\nHowever last night I found myself on the kinder and more fortunate side of her volatile personality, and I was rewarded with the ambient hip-hop stylings of **The Rifts**.\n\nA quartet based in San Bernardino, California, **The Rifts** debut release **Cherry Blossoms** proves a very intriguing first listen. Beginning with a track paradoxically entitled ‘Departure’, the vocals are reminiscent of the gravely stylings of **Eels**, before then bursting into verses of intimate and smooth rap. Cementing this altogether is a finely orchestrated soundtrack of guitar riffs and etheral synths that establish the beautiful hybrid nature of **The Rifts** sound. It is this fusion of genres and styles that elevates **Cherry Blossoms** above the efforts of many similar artists, and most excitingly it promises a considerable level of potential for an even more developed and crafted full length release.",
