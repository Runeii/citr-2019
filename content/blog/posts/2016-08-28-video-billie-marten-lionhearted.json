  "body": "**Billie Marten’s** debut album, **_Writing of Blues and Yellows_**, is shaping up rather beautifully, with latest single _Lionhearted_ being the fifth track lifted from it.\n\nWhilst her early demos showed tremendous promise, these new tracks feel far more mature and part of a fully realised sound – yet maintain the emotional fragility that’s now become such a distinctive part of her aesthetic. Check out Lionhearted below.\n\nLike this?
