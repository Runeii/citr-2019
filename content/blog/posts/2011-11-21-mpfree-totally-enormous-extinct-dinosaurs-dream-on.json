  "body": "The Oxford don’s fast proving he can do what **Hot Chip** and **David E Sugar** were doing in the past with so much ease.\n\nHe probably doesn’t even use both his arms. Decent electronic music and **T.E.E.D.** seem to go hand-in-hand these days. Silly name for a project, but he’s much more accessible for it.\n\nThis new track is very straightforward, and you’ll know what you’re in for if you’ve heard his stuff before. It’s good, honest electro-pop. Thought the Congo would do something for him, but maybe it hasn’t sunk in yet. Saying that, he does seem to be getting progressively more focused with his music, to the point of outshining **Gary Numan** and **Grace Jones** in the synth ‘n’ style areas. I don’t know what I’m saying anymore, so just cop this one below. You should.\n\n_Stream and download Dream On below._",
