  "body": "It’s not often that you get two songs of the same name that are equally incredible, even less likely is the probability of them being released in the same year.\n\nAfter _[July](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/6167-new-youth-lagoon-july)_ by **Youth Lagoon** took the internet by storm earlier in the year, a track of the same title by **Boy Party** looks set to do the same. Gloriously lo-fi vocals and surf-pop guitars orchestrate the majority of _July_, whilst spoken word sections litter the track. It’s these short dialogues that provide a titillating contrast to the sections that are sung; and thus aid _July_ on it’s way to be a track where further intricacies and inspired beauty formulate on repeated listens. _July_ is taken from **_Who Cares?_** the first full length from **Boy Party**, out early September. Stream and download _July_ below.",
