  "body": "During SXSW I had a chance encounter with one of the members of the ever elusive **Lovelier Other.**\n\nHumble, appealingly shy and genuinely deeply grateful for the support they’ve received so far; they had a real air of honesty, much like that embodied by their music. Their new track, _Wonderkind_, may well be their most accomplished work to date, glittering synths sections merge effortlessly with the sweeping violin accompaniment. Despite having yet to grace the live stage, you can be sure that when they do, with tracks like this, they’re destined to impress.",
