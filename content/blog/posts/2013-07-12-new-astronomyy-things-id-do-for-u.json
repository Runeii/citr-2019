  "body": "This is more like it.\n\nWith **astronomyy’s** debut track, the slick, R&B jam [_Don’t Need U_](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/22737-new-as%E2%80%A0ronomyy-dont-need-u/), which flew up the Hype Machine charts, he showcased a vast amount of potential, however with beat felt slightly worn and repetitive, not allowing the vocals to truly breathe. New cut _Things_ _I’d Do For U_ is almost half the length, and is all the better for it. So it’s a sound that’s very much ‘in’ at this moment in time, part Frank Ocean, part Rhye. It’s guaranteed to be played on Radio 1 at some point in the near future, but don’t let that distract from how great a track this is.\n\n_you got me thinking about the things that I do for you_",
