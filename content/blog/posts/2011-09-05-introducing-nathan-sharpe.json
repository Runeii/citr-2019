This debut track from Bristol producer **Nathan Sharpe,** is an intricately beautiful acoustic number, fusing ambient influences and a stellar knowledge of ‘glo-fi’ songwriting. The backing samples and dubstep reminiscent percussion sections really elevate _Escape No Romance_ beyond being just ‘another acoustic track’, and transform it into a rather magnificent piece of work. The vocals are expertly timed and melancholic in tone, whilst the lyrics echo the delivery in their despondent tone; _‘Is this all we’ll ever see? Is this all we’ll ever be?’_ laments **Sharpe** morosely. Don’t let that put you off though, _Escape No Romance_ is a transcendentally moving piece and coupled with **Isaac’s** stunning _Intro/Drowning Roots_, is hopefully a sign of the direction the UK music scene is progressing. Check out Escape No Romance below.",
