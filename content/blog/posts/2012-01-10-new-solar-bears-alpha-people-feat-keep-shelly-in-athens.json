  "date": "2012-01-10T15:38:26",
  "body": "It’s been a while since we last heard from Dublin duo **Solar Bears**, and what better way to announce your return than with an electro-pop classic featuring one of 2012’s most exciting artists? _Alpha People_ plays heavily to **Solar Bears** eclectic influences, proving relentless and expertly utilizing the delicate vocals courtesy of **Sarah** from **Keep Shelly In Athens**.\n\nIt’s got a 60’s swing vibe to it as well, as the track skips along with a seductive groove. Check out _Alpha People_ below.\n\nTheir sophomore full length release is expected later in the year.\n\n[Alpha People](http://soundcloud.com/solar_bears/alpha-people) by [Solar Bears](http://soundcloud.com/solar_bears)",
