  "date": "2013-03-07T22:28:59",
  "body": "For those of you who are unfamiliar with Echopark, though you won’t be for much longer, it is the new project of Italian musician Antonio Elia Forte.\n\nBorn in what is apparently the ‘California of Italy’, Leece, Forte’s journey through life has now found him in Whitechapel and it is here that he has recorded his debut album almost entirely through the use of only a handful of microphones.\n\nEntitled ‘Trees’, Forte’s debut album is out on 15th April here in the UK and the following day in the US, and if ‘Teleportation’ is anything to go by, then it’s going to be an absolute cracker. Infectiously upbeat, you can almost feel rays of  sunlight pervade through the driving percussion, however Forte takes great care in never letting you rest in a bored comfort, rather you’re kept in a state of an enjoyably intriguing flux.\n\nDownload ‘Teleportation’ for free [here.](https://soundcloud.com/enclaves/echopark-teleportation-1/)",
