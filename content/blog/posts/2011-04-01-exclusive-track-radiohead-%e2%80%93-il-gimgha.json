An EXCLUSIVE new Radiohead track, rumoured to be taken from their as yet unannounced follow up to The King Of Limbs. Obtained through a unnameable source, the bizzarely titled IL-ĠIMGĦA sees Yorke in an extremely black mood; choruses of “ah-ah” introduce the track, before the Radiohead frontman’s vocals come in. “Got to make my mind up” whines Yorke over an excruciatingly complex un-rhythmic beat. With The King Of Limbs being received to mixed reviews, this track may go someway to re-igniting the passion some of their loyal fans have lost for the band.\n\n [Radiohead – IL-ĠIMGĦA](http://soundcloud.com/crackintheroad/radiohead-il-img-a) by [crackintheroad](http://soundcloud.com/crackintheroad)",
