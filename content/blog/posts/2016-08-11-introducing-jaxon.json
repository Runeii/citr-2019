  "body": "This new EP from LA’s **Jaxon** is about as smooth yet natural sounding as it gets.\n\nAll centred around some super tight pop songwriting, there’s elements of everyone from Drake to Raury and if I even dare say it, Ed Sheeran, in the slightly sugary but downright addictive hooks. The influences are worn proudly on his sleeve, managing to seamlessly blur classic rock and R&B, whilst sounding completely believable and unique. Check out a couple of personal highlights below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
