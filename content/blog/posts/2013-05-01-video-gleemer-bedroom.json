  "body": "With each and every song **Gleemer** puts out into the world, he’s gradually building upon his fanbase and also strengthening his sound.\n\nThis fitting video encapsulates much of Gleemer’s aesthetic; lo-fi recording combined with a youthful exuberance. _Bedroom_ may well be Gleemer’s most complete track to date, drawing from his debut release [Death Sky, Soft Eye](http://gleemer.bandcamp.com/album/death-sky-soft-eye), whilst dealing with darker themes than we’re used to from **Corey Coffman**. Check out the Jack Garland directed video below.",
