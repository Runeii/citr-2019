  "body": "November 2011 was the first time **Jackie Stabb** appeared on the CitR pages, albeit under a different name, and with a slightly different focus.\n\nA few years on, and she’s just released her debut EP, _**Little Voice**_, partially funded by crowd sourcing from her fan base. Five tracks of wistful, perfectly composed elegance, from the Youth Lagoon-esque riff of Where It Belongs, to her the upbeat, first single, Night Talks, Stabb finds the middle ground between St Vincent and Ellie Goulding. Check out the full EP below, and pick up a [physical](jackiestabb.bigcartel.com) or [digital](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/little-voice-ep/id911960180) copy.",
