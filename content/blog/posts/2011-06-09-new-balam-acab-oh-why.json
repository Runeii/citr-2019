He literally came out of nowhere and cemented the producer as a firm ‘one to watch’ of the year of 2011. The first release from his full-length debut, _Wander / Wonder_, is an emotionally confusing and sonically stimulating piece of music. It has a rather off-kilter ability to comfort through the slow and thoughtful tones of a female singer, while terrifying through the screeches and howls of a child. An introducing introduction to the album. _Wander / Wonder_ will be released on August 29.\n\n [BALAM ACAB – Oh, Why](http://soundcloud.com/tri_angle_records/balam-acab-oh-why) by [TriAngleRecords](http://soundcloud.com/tri_angle_records)",
