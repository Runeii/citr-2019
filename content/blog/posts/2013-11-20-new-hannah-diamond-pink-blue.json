  "body": "There’s no way that you won’t hate the opening few seconds of this track from **Hannah Diamond**.\n\nIt’s almost offensively sugary, bubblegum pop, that would most likely have even the most ardent fans of **Daphne & Celeste** writhing in agony, yet there’s something about it, that makes the entire production so downright loveable. As [Mr Neu](http://www.thisisfakediy.co.uk/articles/neu/the-neu-bulletin-20th-november-2013/) points out, there’s a general feeling of deep-seated satire throughout, from the images that are just begging for Tumblr reblogging, to the connections/similarities to rising odd-pop producer [SOPHIE](https://soundcloud.com/msmsmsm), it’s nothing if not distinctive, and in it’s own manner, utterly brilliant. Check out _Pink & Blue_ below, and then listen again, and again, and again….",
