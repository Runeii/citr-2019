  "body": "This latest track from Austin duo [NÄM](https://soundcloud.</p><p>com/thebandnam) is just undeniably cool. Imagine Lorde covering a Glass Animals track and you begin to understand the sort of vibe they’re on – and whilst electro-pop duos seems to be all the rage right now, they manage to sound refreshingly unique. Marking out a diverse set of inspirations, including Lauryn Hill, Chet Faker and Ta-Ku, _Face_ is the sign of an artist truly beginning to hit their stride.",
