Check this out.\n\n2015 is the 30th anniversary of the Bechdel Test, the handy measure for female representation in film that originated in Allison Bechdel’s comic _Dykes To Watch Out For_. To commemorate the creation of this useful and telling measure [The Bechdel Test Fest](http://bechdeltestfest.com \"The Bechdel Test Fest\") are hosting a series of events throughout the year. For March the theme is **Little Women, Big Stories**; each of the four films has dynamic and inspiring young women at the centre. Furthermore each was written and directed by a woman, which is far too rare an occurrence. After every showing there will be a Q&A from a selection of very talented film folk, including actors, writers and journalists. Take your pick from the screenings below – or be a true film addict and go to all of them!
