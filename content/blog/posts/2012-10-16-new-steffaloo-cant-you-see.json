Still fantastic? Good, we can move on. **_In The Flowers_** will always have a special place in my heart, it erupts when I want it to erupt, it focuses exactly when I desire it to, but most importantly of all, it surprises me every single time I listen to it. Very few tracks can do this while still taking you on a journey that’s in any way tangible. It also takes me back to a time when, for want of a better word, I was really fucking sad. It reminds me of blinding pain, and yet, it also reminds of an eventual smile after sitting silent in a party for 3 hours. Songs like this don’t inspire you to think ‘everything’s going to be ok’, they inspire you to think ‘everything IS ok’.\n\nSteffaloo: everything is ok.\n\n_Would You Stay_ comes out October 23rd via [Mush Records](http://www.mushrecords.com/release/MH285.php).",
