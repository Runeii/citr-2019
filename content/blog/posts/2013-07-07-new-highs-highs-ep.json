  "title": "New: HIGHS – HIGHS EP",
  "date": "2013-07-07T22:04:40",
  "body": "Announcing themselves with a flurry of demos towards the latter end of last year, Toronto’s **HIGHS** are back with their debut EP proper.\n\nFeaturing the previously heard Summer Dress and Nomads, their monstrously upbeat, vaguely **Vampire Weekend**\\-esque pop is bewitching and beautifully composed. There’s a real togetherness and understanding to their sound, with Harvest being arguably their most complete track to date. Check out the full EP below, and keep up with the group via [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/highsmusic).",
