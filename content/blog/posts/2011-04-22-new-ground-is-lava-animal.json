[**Ground Is Lava**](http://www.myspace.com/thegroundislavadude) happens to be one of those producers. His new tune _Animal,_ featuring the vocally competent Weary, is perfect for watching a bank holiday sunset. Oh and check out the sinister video that accompanies the track, if you like go pick it up at [**Friends Of Friends.**](http://www.fofmusic.net/?p=2116)\n\n[Groundislava – Animal ft.
