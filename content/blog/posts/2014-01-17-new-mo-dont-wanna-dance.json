  "body": "This takes me back to my early teens, where almost every track on my iPod began with Zane Lowe ranting over the top of it ‘THIS IS THE HOTTEST RECORD IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW’, and then cutting it off a minute before it reaches it’s best moments.\n\nThe joys of Limewire, huh?\n\nAnyway, this new single from Danish songstress **MØ** is all killer, no filler, showing off everything that’s so exciting and addictive about her music. The chorus has a real 70’s swing feel to, in fact, there’s moments where it’s like it’s been lifted directly from a broadway musical, and that’s meant entirely the best light. It’s a classic. Check out _Don’t Wanna Dance_ below, lifted from her debut LP, No Mythologies To Follow, out 10 March, [pre-order here](http://smarturl.it/MO_NMTF_digi).",
