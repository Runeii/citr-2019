  "body": "I’m pretty stumped by these tracks from Copenhagen’s **The Overture**.\n\nSo the production, particularly on the vocals, leaves rather a lot to be desired, but there’s something there, lurking underneath the cheesy, 80’s inspired pop hooks. Of the two tracks, _As We Change_ stands out, mainly for it’s soulful roots, and rather awesome guitar solo. As mentioned previously, the overall production highlighted by what comes across as heavy handed piano playing on _A River Running Wild_, lets down the quality of the tracks. That said, it’ll be interesting to see where The Overture. travels from here. Check out both tracks below.",
