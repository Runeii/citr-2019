The new single, _Flashes_, is a pop tune to the very core. It’s succinct, catchy and has an immersive narrative strapped to its sleeve. It’s actually rather menacing at times; the blissful pop sounds clashing sublimely with the grimly optimistic lyrics are an interesting slant on the formula.\n\nIt also comes complete with a striking new video that could possibly point towards the inspiration for the piece. Check it out below.\n\n[Lama – Flashes](http://vimeo.com/26101889) from [Lavafilm](http://vimeo.com/lavafilm) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
