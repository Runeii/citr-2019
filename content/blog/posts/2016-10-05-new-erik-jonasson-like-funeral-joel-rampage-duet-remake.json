  "date": "2016-10-05T15:31:35",
  "body": "Loved the original of this track, so was slightly wary when I saw that there was a ‘remix’ of sorts – however it’s not your conventional, run of the mill, rework; instead Joel Rampage (of Postiljonen) turns **Erik Jonasson’s** _Like A Funeral_ into an epic, soaring number, including the addition of vocals from Mia of Postiljonen.\n\nPretty beautiful, life-affirming stuff.
