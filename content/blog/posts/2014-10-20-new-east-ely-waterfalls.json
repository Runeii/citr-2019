  "body": "Sydney five piece **East of Ely** have a knack for penning massive hooks and colossal choruses.\n\nTheir first two tracks, _Easy Friend_ and _Came Without_ were classic, Springsteen tinged numbers, the sort of tracks you’d put on a road trip CD, preferably a trip involving plenty of driving along never ending, expansive highways. Their third offering, _Waterfalls_, is another slice of Americana infused indie-pop, centred around fist pumping choruses that The Killers would be proud of. Check out Waterfalls below, and pre-order the EP [here](https://itunes.apple.com/au/album/east-of-ely-ep/id926304279).",
