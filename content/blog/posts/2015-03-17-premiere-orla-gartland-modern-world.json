  "body": "When looking through all that **Orla Gartland** has achieved in her career so far, it’s clear that she has experience well beyond her modest nineteen years – with her 2013’s _Roots EP _storming the charts in her home country, and this years _Lonely People EP _receiving rave reviews across the board.\n\n The newest offering from the Dublin singer/songwriter, _Modern World_, is a slice of joyously upbeat pop, all centred around one of the finest, most addictive choruses you’ll hear this side of 2015. Addressing the all too real issues of complicated adolescence, alongside attempting to find an identity within a society that at times, offers few answers, it’s not too far from the likes of The 1975 or Magic Man. Following on from a colossal UK tour featuring a vast majority of sold out dates, Orla Gartland plays three SXSW shows this week, including one at [B.D Riley’s](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/20229-announcement-citr-x-disco-naivete-present-dark-paradise-sxsw) and an official showcase at Maggie Mae’s tomorrow night.\n\n*   _3/18, 11p at Music From Ireland showcase, Maggie Mae’s Gibson Room, 512 Trinity St_\n*   _3/20, 11:35a at Irish Breakfast at B.D. Riley’s Irish Pub & Restaurant, 204 East 6th Street, Austin, TX 78701, United States_\n*   _3/21, 1p at Goorin Bros., 1323 South Congress Avenue, Austin, TX 78704 US_\n\n*   March 24: **San Francisco, CA** @ Brick and Mortar Music Hall\n*   March 25: **Los Angeles, CA** @ Hotel Cafe",
