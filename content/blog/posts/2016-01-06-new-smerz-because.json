  "body": "As premiered by i-D, Norwegian duo Smerz have revealed their brilliant new single ‘Because’.\n\nEntering with a techno spun beat, the track further opens into a smooth, swaying world of crisp vocals and intoxicating synth lines.\n\nWe caught Smerz perform at Øya Festival last year and their live show matches their strength on record, which in turn definitely makes them an outfit to watch out for in 2016.",
