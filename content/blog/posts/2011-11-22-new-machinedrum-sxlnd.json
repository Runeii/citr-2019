  "body": "As if **Machinedrum** couldn’t kill it any more this year.\n\nThe Brooklyn producer released _Many Faces_ last year on **LuckyMe**, announcing his comeback and cementing him as a significant face on the bass scene. Then he only comes and releases a terrifyingly top-marks album on **Planet Mu**, called _Room(s)_, a recent critical hit with his mate **Braille** as their **Seplacure** project on **Hotflush**, and a not-ready-for-this underhyped single on **LuckyMe** (that was _Alarma_). Not only has he done this, but he produced the hot-as-shit **Azealia Banks** track [we covered just a week ago](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/12569-new-azealia-banks-grand-scam-lyrical-exercise/).\n\nThis run he’s got going doesn’t look to be letting down, as shown from clips of his new release on **LuckyMe**, due next week (29th). Ignoring the brash “LUCKY ME!” promo shouts/whispers, you can preview the EP below. And it looks to be another hip-bopping housy affair. Let’s hope this guy doesn’t have a heart attack soon: electronic music today would have a massive void to fill.\n\n_Listen to clips from SXLND below._",
