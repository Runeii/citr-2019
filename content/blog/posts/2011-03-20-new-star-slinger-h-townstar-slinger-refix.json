If this is your first time hearing of him, then you’re in for a treat! Rapidly garnering a hardcore following both in the UK and abroad, his debut record **_Volume 1_** dropped last year, and since then he’s hardly stopped producing new remixes and tracks, as well as playing a score of shows around Europe. Today he dropped a new remix, set to be included in upcoming live sets, a chilled out, laid back take of **H-Town’s** _They Like It Slow_. Like much of his previous work it maintains a soulful vibe, despite being instantaneously catchy and danceable. Check it out and download below.\n\n [H-Town – They Like It Slow (Star Slinger Refix)](http://soundcloud.com/starslingeruk/h-town-they-like-it-slow-star) by [Star Slinger](http://soundcloud.com/starslingeruk)",
