  "body": "The collaborative brainchild of New Zealand singer / songwriter Christy Whelan and Israeli ambient guitarist Arli Liberman, **The RIVE Project’s** debut offering, _Open Road_, is anthemic indie pop at it’s absolute best.\n\nCombining real hearts-on-sleeves, fists to the sky songwriting, with super slick, ambitious production, it manages to be simultaneously stadium ready whilst endearingly intimate – perfect for those summer playlists.\n\nWith their debut EP, **_Wanna Change_**, available in late September, alongside a London headline show at Sebright Arms set for 3 October, these next few months are set to be rather special for The RIVE Project. Open Road is out tomorrow (19 August) on their own label, Rive Records).\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
