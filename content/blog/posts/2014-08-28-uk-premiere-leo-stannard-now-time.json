  "title": "UK Premiere: Leo Stannard – Now Is Not The Time",
  "date": "2014-08-28T11:21:27",
  "body": "Already one of the UK’s hottest unsigned talents, 18 year old **Leo Stannard** is set to release his second EP, **_Notions_**, later this year.\n\nWith Why Don’t We released earlier this month to critical acclaim from numerous top publications, he’s now followed it up with the more folk orientated _Now Is Not The Time_. Managing to maintain a lyrical poignancy whilst still being a surefire radio hit is pretty difficult nowadays, but Stannard hits the nail right on the head, mixing the hooks of Ed Sheeran, with the composure of Ben Howard. Yet again proving his songwriting prowess, most notably his ability to penn a killer chorus which when combined with his stunning vocals show that he’s well and truly primed for the big time. Check out Now Is Not The Time below.",
