  "title": "New: Keep Shelly In Athens – Just Like Honey",
  "date": "2012-01-31T00:07:18",
  "body": "Having recently appeared on several tracks by other producers, **Keep Shelly In Athens** are back recording under their own name again, this time with a cover of **The Jesus & Mary Chain’s** _Just Like Honey_.\n\n**Sarah’s** vocals are as fragile and splendid as ever, whilst the reverb-laden guitar caries the track, transforming the 1985 hit into a wonderfully touching number, building into a gloriously epic finale. The cover will feature on a charity compilation, which you can find more information on [here](http://justlikehoney.co.uk/covercompil). The release finds eleven bands covering the same track, each with a unique take on it, including the likes of **Seapony**, **Wanda and Wonder** and **We Are Enfant Terrible**. All profits from the sale of the tracks, which can be found [here](http://justlikehoney.bandcamp.com/album/just-like-honey), go towards [Breast Cancer Care](http://breastcancercare.org.uk/).",
