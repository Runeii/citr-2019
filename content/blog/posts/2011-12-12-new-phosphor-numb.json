  "body": "This new cut from London outfit **PHOSPHOR** comes in somewhere between **The XX** and **Purity Ring**; maintaining the atmospheric vibe of both acts, whilst neither giving in entirely to it’s pop capabilities nor being off-puttingly obscure.\n\nThere are shoegaze influences hidden amongst the shallow guitar lines and reverb laden vocals, making for an intriguing listen. Check out _Numb_ below, and grab another couple of their tracks [here](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/12501-new-phosphor-blossom-cold-hearted/).\n\n [Numb](http://soundcloud.com/phosphor-band/numb) by [PHOSPHOR.](http://soundcloud.com/phosphor-band)",
