  "body": "Ahead of the release of their debut LP _**Shrines**_, out 24 July on [4AD](http://shopusa.4ad.com/featured-4ad-homepage/shrines), _Purity Ring_ have dropped a new track set to feature on the record. _Fineshrine_ is as deliciously addictive as their previous outings, fusing glitched vocal samples with excessive sidechain usage and a ludicrously upbeat chorus. Although it’s still very early to predict, given the online buzz surrounding the ‘future pop’ duo are set to kick up a serious fuss in 2012. Check out _Fineshrine_ below.",
