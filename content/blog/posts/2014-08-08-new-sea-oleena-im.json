  "date": "2014-08-08T13:52:15",
  "body": "It seems like a mighty long time since **Sea Oleena** released [Sleeplessness](http://seaoleena.</p><p>bandcamp.com/album/sleeplessness), one of 2011’s highlights and a record I still regularly return to – a stunning listen throughout, comfortably one of the most beautiful records of recent times. Having filmed a gorgeous session for our friends at [PORTALS](http://www.portalsmusic.com/2014/08/features/sessions-sea-oleena/), she’s back with her first new material in a while, and the first to be released on her new home, Lefse Records. _If I’m_ is a tender, intimate five minute journey through a fractured consciousness, abandoning any form of traditional songwriting structure, and proving all the more exquisite for it. Check out If I’m below, as well as her PORTALS session, and keep your eyes peeled for **_Shallow_**, released 30 September via [Lefse Record](http://www.lefserecords.com/), [preorder here](http://lefserecords.limitedrun.com/products/531890-sea-oleena-shallow-pre-order).",
