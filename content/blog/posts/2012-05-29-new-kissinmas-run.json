  "body": "Awkwardly sidling in like the slightly less eloquent younger brother of **The Coral**, French sextet **Kissinmas** have a continental swagger that’s grounded upon years of listening to **_Revolver_** on their dads cassette player.\n\nNew single _Run_ packs a punch and a half, with it’s blissfully upbeat choruses and decidedly simple guitar hooks. So it’s not going to win any awards nor propel them to superstardom, but it certainly forms a pleasant musical backdrop for everyday activities.\n\n<a href=\"http://kissinmas.bandcamp.com/track/run\">Run by Kissinmas</a>",
