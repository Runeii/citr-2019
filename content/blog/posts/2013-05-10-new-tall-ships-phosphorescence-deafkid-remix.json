  "body": "It’s a tough call.\n\nBut I don’t _care_ if _Best_ _Ever_’s bonkers twiddle-rock  still splits my face in half on every listen. Or indeed that _Gallop_ is probably the most exuberant song about aging that I’ve ever had the pleasure of hearing,  makes humanity’s debilitating fear of ever-encroaching time sound like something to celebrate. Because the best thing about **_Everything Touching_** is still [the way that it ends](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YauB3cPgI_Y \"Like Ronseal.\").\n\n_Murmurations,_ the song that closes [Brighton-via-Cornwall bros](http://wearetallships.co.uk/) **Tall Ships**‘ first full-length,  is nine and a quarter minutes of slow-building arpeggios and percussive clatters, looped over a four-to-the-floor beat somewhere around 130bpm. A house beat. The whole thing ascends teasingly skyward until the 6-minute mark, whereupon it bursts everywhere in a glorious Technicolor splatter. There’s probably a choir in there. It’s one of the best approximations of actual dance music I’ve ever heard a band with guitars make.\n\nSo that album track _Phosphorescence_ has been given a groovealicious redux by **Deafkid** – [the duo partly responsible](http://www.deafkidband.com/) for the production on _**Peanut Butter and Melancholy Jam**_ –  makes perfect sense to me. The chaply-monikered Christopher Lockington and Florian Sauvaire (for it is they) haven’t opted for the [total immersion approach](http://stereogum.com/1306522/at-the-drive-in-one-armed-scissor-the-field-remix/mp3s/ \"For example, the Field's frankly incomprehensible take on One Armed Scissor\") – at the outset, they’re content to keep vocal lines front and centre, over a sparkling loop not exactly 12 parsecs from Tall Ships’ usual _modus operandi_. But from a minute in, _Phosphorescence_ is reimagined as something slinking and soulful, driven by warm keys, a techy beat. The once-robust coda of [the lolloping, bloopy original](https://soundcloud.com/tallships/phosphorescence \"Kind of the aural equivalent of a happy Labrador puppy.\") goes woozy on the back of some ket-addled synths, voices echoing mournfully through a tunnel of clicks and claps. It’s pretty great.\n\nTall Ships are playing at Concord 2 on May 18th (that’s next Saturday), as part of the Rock Sound showcase at [The Great Escape](http://mamacolive.com/thegreatescape/). If anyone wants to buy me a ticket, that’d be swell.",
