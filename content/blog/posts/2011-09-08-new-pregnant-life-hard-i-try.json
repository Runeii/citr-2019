  "body": "Daniel Trudeau a.\n\nk.a **[Pregnant](http://danielispregnant.tumblr.com/)** dropped a new record yesterday on **[Mush Records](http://www.mushrecords.com/release/202)**. 14 tracks of buoyant, jerky and glitchy folk fueled jams. As with all of **Pregnant**’s work, experimentation is key, but always without sacrificing a groove or a catchy hook. With his new record, ‘_Life Hard: I try_’, the balance is stretched to perfection. The beats are tactile and playful, they create a backdrop to Trudea’s exceptional ability to sample and manipulate the vast array of instruments he plays; it feels organic while being fiercely futuristic.\n\nStream the album below, and buy it [here.](http://www.mushrecords.com/release/202)",
