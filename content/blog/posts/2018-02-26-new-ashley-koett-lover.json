  "body": "Most break-up songs really suck.\n\nThey don’t get to the heart of what it’s truly like to lose someone. It’s not the cliches of waking up alone that hit hardest; it’s simply the continuation of life, knowing that you’re both going on without each other. So it makes it all the more refreshing to hear **Ashley Koett’s** latest single, which digs deep into the anguish of losing someone you really care about, specifically seeing them with another. _Lover_ hits hard lyrically, relying on Koett’s exquisitely unique vocal – making lines like ‘_everything is real / that you’re not here / that you don’t love me_‘ get even further under the skin. Check it out below.",
