  "body": "**[Ifan Dafydd](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/9122-new-ifan-dafydd-no-goodmiranda/ \"New: Ifan Dafydd – No good/Miranda\")** was an artist who dominated 2011 despite only releasing one split single, entitled ‘_No Good/ Miranda_’. What’s likely to be rather less inconspicuous is his prominence in 2012. With his next release, another split single, due out at the end of this month, it could very well be an extremely exciting year for the young producer. The tracks have also progressed dramatically, with far more organic and orchestral textures dominating the tracks. ‘_Treehouse_’ is a dizzying and chaotic instrumental world wind, while ‘_To Me_’ is composed, restrained and not too unlike tracks from the great **Nicolas Jaar**’s debut record.",
