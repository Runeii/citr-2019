  "body": "Damn, really falling for this LA duo, **French Royalty** (Paige Califano and Josh Story) and their self-titled debut EP.\n\nFrom the brilliantly bizarre and over the top (_Daggers_), to the straight up pop of EP closer _Palm Tree Sadness_, they instil the sensuality of a Lana Del Rey or Lykke Li, with the ability to write a killer electronic-pop song that we’ve seen recently from the likes of CHVRCHES and Broods. There’s a real memorable kick to French Royalty, and definitely enough to suggest that they’re well worth keeping an eye on. Check out the full EP below.\n\n<a href=\"http://frenchroyalty.bandcamp.com/album/french-royalty\">French Royalty by French Royalty</a>",
