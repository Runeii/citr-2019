  "body": "Someone has clearly had their grubby little mits all over the new **My Bloody Valentine** record, and I mean that in the best way possible.\n\nWith their first offering of 2013, Manchester quartet **Shinies** bring out the shoegaze, on what is possibly their closest track to ‘a love song’ so far. Feedback dominated guitars, sleazy yet oh so sincere lyrics accompanied by a cheeky live video, if this doesn’t get them any Valentines Day roses, then nothing will. Check out _SHUGA_ below.  \n\n[SHUGA](http://vimeo.com/59600279) from [SHINIES](http://vimeo.com/user16447708) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
