  "body": "Having announced their return with the rather understated release of new track [Octopus](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/17216-new-bloc-party-octopus/) back at the start of July, **Bloc Party** have unveiled another track to be taken from forthcoming LP _**Four**_. _Day Four_ finds the quartet in a melancholic, remorseful spirit, reminiscing about relationships, addictions and idealized loves. As with [Octopus](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/17216-new-bloc-party-octopus/), it’s a track that is sure to excel on the live circuit, utilizing **Kele’s** immaculate vocals superbly. Check out _Day Four_ below and pre-order Four via [iTunes](http://smarturl.it/blocpartyfour) now, out 20 August.",
