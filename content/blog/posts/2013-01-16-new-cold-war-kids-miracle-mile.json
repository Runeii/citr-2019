  "body": "Rapidly approaching their ten year anniversary, it feels like an age since **Cold War Kids** were splattered across the pages of every new music magazine.\n\nNine years on from their formation, and lead singer **Nathan Willett** still has one of the best voices around, as shown on new track Miracle Mile. Their first new material in almost two years, it’s faster paced than previous outings, whilst maintaining the West Coast blues vibes found on the tracks that initially catapulted them to fame (Hang Me Up To Dry, Hospital Beds). Miracle Mile is taken from their fourth album, titled **_Dear Miss Lonelyhearts_** out 1 April, which will be supported by a couple of UK shows (dates below).\n\n9th May – Forum –  London, UK\n\n10th May – Ritz –  Manchester, UK",
