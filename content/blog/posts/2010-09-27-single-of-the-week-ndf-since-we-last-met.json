  "body": "This weeks single of the week comes from the world of Minimal Techno.\n\nLegend of the scene **Bruno Pronsato** and **Sergio Giorgini** form **NDF**, a surprising addition to the roster of New York label **DFA Records**, usually known for its house and electro output, genre’s most at home in the record labels back yard.\n\nThe track is a spacious minimal epic, built around a calming and washy vocal sample, a slow building and intensely captivating bass line and a simple meandering synth line. On the other side, **Ricardo Villalobos** provides a very rigid and awkwardly arranged remix, that is somewhat disappointing.\n\n_Since We Last Met_ is an essential dance track, the sort of thing that could deliver euphoria as part of a DJ set, that would also be appropriate listening during a long bus journey.\n\n[Buy Since We Last Met Here](http://boomkat.com/vinyl/325389-luke-abbott-holkham-drones)",
