  "body": "London’s **Tenterhook** aka Archie Faulks cropped up on quite a few radars earlier in the year with his stunning debut offering, _Stereo_.\n\nHaving followed it up with a couple of sold out shows, and a second track, Chemicals, he’s now released a fitting video for his debut, perfectly mirroring the tender, delicate atmosphere of the track itself. With a rapidly growing fan base, and a [self-titled EP](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/tenterhook-ep/id898235210) out 25 August, expect Tenterhook to make serious inroads in 2015. Check out the beautiful video for Stereo (directed by Jessica Hughes) below.",
