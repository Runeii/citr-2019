  "body": "London’s **AUGUST** (Stephen Hughes) impressed a few months back with his heavenly debut track _SWORD_, a mix of silky production and expansive songwriting.\n\nReturning with his second offering, in the form of Animal, another gloriously ethereal number, which manages to merge chart ready, anthemic songwriting, with a gorgeous sense of fragility, maintaining the emotional honesty of his debut. Comparison wise, there’s elements of the likes of SOHN and Chet Faker, yet all set against more outwardly accessible, unforgettable songwriting. Check it out below.",
