  "title": "New: Isaac Lee-Kronick – Running Man",
  "date": "2016-02-08T11:37:46",
  "body": "As premiered by Noisey, Isaac Lee-Kronick has entered into the ever present fray of new music with a superb debut effort in the shape of ‘Running Man’.\n\nDescribed by Isaac himself as a representation of a ‘kaleidoscopic confusion’, the track itself flourishes around a bold, infectious chorus amongst a bed of tropical fused percussion and bursts of instrumental sounds. ‘Running Man’ is very much a track that one should allow time to live with and to fully appreciate, and in turn cement your desire for further music from this very promising North Londoner.",
