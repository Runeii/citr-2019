  "body": "I’ll be damned if this isn’t one of the finest pop songs of the year thus far.\n\nYou may recognize the vocals of **Molly Beanland**, also of **Cub Scout** who have previously graced the [**CitR** pages](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14845-new-cub-scout-lost/) before, and as per, they’re as refined and delicately elegant as ever. _Electric_ is an early 90’s pop throwback, with echoes of classic hits from better years gone by. For me, it’s a timely reminder, that yes, this is it; we’re young, lost and more beautiful than ever before.\n\nWith **Skruncha-roo** (**Kyle Vento**) on production duties, and a collaboration track between the two of them on the way shortly, these are truly exciting times for **Beanland** and **Vento**.\n\nNB: Not actual artwork.",
