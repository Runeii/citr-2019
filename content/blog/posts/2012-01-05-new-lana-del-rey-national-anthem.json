  "body": "With just under a month until the release of her debut LP _**Born To Die**_, another track set to feature on the record has found it’s way onto the internet.\n\nIt’s an upbeat, R’n’B styled number, quite **GaGa**\\-esque in nature if I’m honest, but in typical **Lana** fashion, it just works. Whether these staggered leaks are a ploy to keep the blogosphere buzzing or someone out there has a personal vendetta to settle, who knows, either way, it’s certainly serving to build anticipation for her upcoming record. Check out _National Anthem_ below.",
