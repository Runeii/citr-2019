  "body": "Got to admit, I dropped the ball on **Alma Elste** a little, missing out on her debut single, _Heart Melter_ which cropped up online toward the tail end of 2014.\n\nManaging to sound strangely retro, yet very much in keeping with the current late 70’s / early 80’s revivalists (we’re talking HAIM, Sky Ferreira, there’s even something vaguely The 1975-esque about the guitar riff), it feels effortless and even organic if such a term could be used. Latest track, Virtualism, is wistful and nostalgic, instantly throwing up Lana Del Rey comparisons, yet set against a backdrop of swirling synths of M83 level proportions – it’s a definite keeper. Check out both tracks below.",
