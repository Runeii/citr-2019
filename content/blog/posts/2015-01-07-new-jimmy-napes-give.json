  "body": "Having made a name for himself by working behind the scenes with the likes of Disclosure, Sam Smith and Mary J Blige, **Jimmy Napes** almost feels like a household name already, despite not having released a note of music under his own name.\n\n_Give It Up_, his debut single premiered on Zane Lowe’s R1 show earlier tonight, yet again showcases his ability to pen a killer pop song. There’s touches of Josef Salvat, Jungle, and of course the more house/dance orientated elements usually associated with Disclosure (no surprise given that Howard from the duo co-produced). Check it out below.",
