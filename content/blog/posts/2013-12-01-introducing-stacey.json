  "body": "Singer/Songwriter, STACEY, from Toronto translates the cold of Canada into an icy piano ballad titled “Worst Part.\n\n” Harmonizing with herself over undulating piano melodies, Stacey sings “you leave me wanting more” and “I need you.” Producer Alex Bonenfant uses the same lo-fi, slightly distorted, vocals heard in his other projects including Metz and Crystal Castles. It’s a breathy ballad that truly leaves you _wanting more_ and coincidentally thats the _worst part_.\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/106927871″ width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]",
