  "date": "2013-02-08T09:06:33",
  "body": "Georgia rapper, Kris J, has put together a slick mixtape, entitled #inspiredby, for his first release.\n\nHis rhymes, while doing nothing particularly revolutionary, are delivered with the poise of a far more experienced artist, finding the right trade-off between punchy and chilled-out.\n\nThe beats are immediate and, although he hails from the south of the US, and this undoubtedly forms the backbone of his sound, you can hear an east-coast tinge on a number of the tracks. Clocking in a petite 12 songs, the album doesn’t slip into tedium, although there are a couple of weaker tracks in the middle of the mixtape.\n\nYou can stream and download the whole thing below. Highlights include ‘We Bang’, ‘Fresh Dressed’ and ‘Conversation Music’.\n\n  \n[Download Mixtape](http://www.datpiff.com/Kris-J-inspiredby-mixtape.450188.html) | [Free Mixtapes](http://www.datpiff.com) Powered by [DatPiff.com](http://www.datpiff.com/ \"Free Mixtapes\")",
