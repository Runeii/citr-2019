  "date": "2012-11-14T16:21:29",
  "body": "Having now undergone several name changes, it appears that things are finally falling into place for Manchester outfit **The 1975**.\n\nStandout track _Sex_ forms the backbone of their new EP of the same title, a collection of future indie anthems destined to be blasted out to thousands of adoring fans at festivals across the world. The aforementioned _Sex_ and _You_ are the highlights of the release, whilst _Intro/Set 3_ and _Undo_ are more reserved affairs, not as instantaneously catchy but sure to prove live favourites. Check out the full EP below, and pre-order it from [iTunes](http://smarturl.it/the1975sexep).",
