  "date": "2012-02-07T23:14:06",
  "body": "With the wealth of genre bending music circling around the web, (THANKS MR.\n\nINTERNET), it’s often the most reserved, soft spoken and simple music that takes you by surprise. [**Ryan Power**’s](http://ryanpower.org/) delicately pleading pop song, ‘**_I don’t want to die_**’, is one of those tracks. It glistens with its smooth and subdued production, while Powers’ vocals act as the most beautiful suicide negotiation ever spoken. Full of regret, anguish and fear; it’s a realist human struggle story that can’t fail to move.\n\n**_I Don’t Want to Die_** is out April 3 via [NNA Tapes](http://nnatapes.com/).
