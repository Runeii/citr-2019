  "date": "2013-02-21T07:45:40",
  "body": "Dialate has just put out his latest track, which is an ode to the joy of smoking weed.\n\nThis is a topic that has received a large amount of coverage in the rap industry, but the barsmith really makes the topic his own. ‘Another One’ clocks in at just under two minutes, but remains a riveting listen. Dialate’s flow is sharp and accurate, spraying percussive rhythms over the minimal beat, which the artist produced himself.\n\n‘Another One’ is currently available for free download, but, if you don’t have time for that, you can also stream the track below. Isn’t life lovely?",
