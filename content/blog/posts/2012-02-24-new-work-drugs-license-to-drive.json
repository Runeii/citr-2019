  "body": "**Work Drugs** have this hugely enviable ability to be able to write insanely catchy pop tracks, and boy do they show it on _License To Drive_, their first new material of 2012.\n\nAs they put it so sweetly, this is music to ‘sext’ to; I can just picture driving through a picturesque, slightly run-down American suburb in a beat-up faux-Cadillac, with some cute girls in the back of the car, roof down, hair flying, _License To Drive_ blasting through the speakers. Thank you **Work Drugs** for allowing me to dream.",
