  "body": "More new **Thundercat** with **Flying Lotus**, from yet another Japanese bonus disc exclusive.\n\nAre these the new Blues Brothers or something? You can half-imagine these guys sat in outside a jazz café in the sun sipping on something strong and smoking something illegal, then just moseying on down to the back room and jamming out something laid-back and honest just like this.\n\nThe subtlety of this track is blissful – all players riffing off each other, **FlyLo**‘s often bravado studio stylings held back for a very backseat affair. I can just imagine him reclining with that wide grin of his, letting **Thundercat** drive the track and **Austin Peralta** sitting shotgun. A lot of love coming from this track. Short but sweet. Looking forward to some more improv sessions stuff from the **Brainfeeder** camp.\n\n_Listen to $200 TB below._",
