  "body": "Arriving with her debut track ‘Jesus Made Me Bad’, Lao Ra has made a strong statement of intent.\n\nSparking with energy and galvanized with a effortless blanket of style, ‘Jesus Made My Bad’ is very much directed from a pop sentiment while remaining entirely personable. Channeling feelings of MIA, and the glitchy pop production of SOPHIE, the track is inspired by Lao Ra’s upbringing in Bogota, Colombia, along with her MTV escapism as she tried to avoid the war of drugs which ravaged the city in the 90’s.\n\nA striking effort, and a piece of music that only furthers the intrigue surrounding this very promising artist.",
