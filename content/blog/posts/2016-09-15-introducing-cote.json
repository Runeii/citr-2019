  "body": "_London_, the debut outing from NY singer **COTE** became one of those tracks that I found myself going back to time and time again.\n\nDelightfully considered, there’s tinges of Fleetwood Mac and Angel Olsen to the songwriting, with just enough of a pop sensibility to make it demand repeat listens. Her newest release, _Green Light_, is a slightly more upbeat offering, embodying an almost War on Drugs / Springsteen style swagger. Check it out below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
