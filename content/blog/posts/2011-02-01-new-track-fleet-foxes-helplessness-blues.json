As well as being the first song made available from the record, Helplessness Blues will also be the title of the full length album, expected at the start of May.\n\nThe albums title track continues in a similar vein to their debut record, poetic and mournful in tone. It’s folk roots are glaringly obvious, as lead vocalist Robin Pecknold bemoans “I don’t know who to believe, I’ll get back to you someday soon, you will see”. One can’t help but feel that Fleet Foxes are preparing to take people’s mainstream music consciousness by storm; there’s no doubting 2011 is set to be an eventful and important year for the Seattle group.\n\n[Download Helplessness Blues](http://www.fleetfoxes.com/helplessness-blues.html)",
