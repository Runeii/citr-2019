  "body": "![](http://bt-dubs.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/jamie-xx.jpg \"jamie XX\")After announcing the release of a solely Gil Scott-Heron featuring record, Jamie XX has dropped a second track setx to appear on the album. After premiered NY Is Killing Me, the first of his reworks, anticipation for the full length LP began to grow, and this new effort will only raise the bar. I’ll Take Care Of You maintains the soulful vibe originally generated by Scott-Heron, yet towards the mid point of the track, Jamie XX takes it up a notch. Repetitive beats and pop-fulled synths turn this number into a sure fire classic, whilst there are still many who doubt Jamie’s skill as a live DJ, his undeniably excellent back catalogue of remixes are cementing him as one of the finest producers of current times. Take a listen to I’ll Take Care Of You below.",
