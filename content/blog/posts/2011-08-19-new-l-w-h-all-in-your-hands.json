  "body": "Yesterday our friends over at **[Get Off The Coast](http://getoffthecoast.blogspot.com/)** premiered the new track from L.W.H. and a group of producer/Mcs that have been impressing as of late; namely **[Main Attrakionz](http://mishkanyc.bandcamp.com/album/main-attrakionz-808s-dark-grapes-ii)**, **Shady Blaze** & **[Friendzone](http://www.facebook.com/friendzonemusic)**. The track itself is glorious. 3 and a half minutes of euphoric synth instrumentation, that feels like the audio equivalent of watching the stars. It will make you melt.\n\nThe flows from **Main Attrakionz** & **Shady Blaze** give a dose of relativity to what could have been a simply elevating experience. ‘_The world is crazy, I used to want to help, but then I leant I can’t save it. But I can damn sure save myself_”, it’s empowering yet demolishing to listen to; and all to a back drop that will make you feel that nothing matters anyway.\n\nStream and download below.",
