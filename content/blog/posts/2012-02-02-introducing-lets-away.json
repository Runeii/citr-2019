  "body": "It’s bizarre the coincidences that life throws up from time to time.\n\nTake **Let’s Away**, the North East’s current ‘buzz band’, whom having heard a couple of tracks from the duo and deciding to write about them, I, as I always do, performed a quick Google search to gather some more information on the two-piece, and promptly discovered that I used to play football alongside one of their members. Strange, huh?\n\nAnyway, all that aside, the two tracks that **Let’s Away** have unleashed so far are emotionally fraught slices of indie-pop, taking on a very 60’s-esque mantra, and verging upon becoming full-blown ballads. _Only In The Dark_ is a slow-burner; melodic and despondent in style, like **Alex Turner** at his utmost remorseful, whereas _Art Of Self Control_ displays a rougher edge, retelling a seemingly extremely personal affair. Whilst the duo’s [website](http://letsawaymusic.wordpress.com/) looks rather bare at the moment, and they’re yet to perform live, I anticipate it only being a matter of time before they begin to cause some serious waves. Check out both tracks below.\n\n</p> <p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F26354882&#038;show\\_artwork=true\">",
