  "date": "2011-11-23T22:57:04",
  "body": "Shot off the coast of Spain and directed by **Natalia Stuyk**, this new video from **Echo Lake** is a beautifully edited piece of work.\n\nThe idyllic yet slightly cliched settings and seductive imagery are complimented by the colour scheme, focusing on drowsy blues and organic greens. The track that accompanies the clip is a shoegaze/chillwave affair, with the percussion playing a dominant role alongside the hazy vocals. There’s no narrative as such to _Buried At Sea_, yet the gorgeous effects more than make up for any misgivings you may have over that.\n\n_Buried At Sea_ is out now via **[No Pain In Pop](http://nopaininpop.greedbag.com/buy/young-silence/)**, and will also feature on an upcoming 12″ split release with **Gross Magic**, **The History Of Apple Pie** and **Novella** on [**Marshall Teller Records**](http://www.marshalltellerrecords.bigcartel.com/product/mt0011-12-split-gross-magic-thoap-echo-lake-novella-pre-order).\n\n[Echo Lake – Buried at Sea](http://vimeo.com/32261737) from [///NO PAIN IN POP\\\\\\\\\\\\](http://vimeo.com/nopaininpop) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
