Now we are proud to be able to bring you another song from the forthcoming album which is released worldwide on the 10th of May. _Afraid Of Everyone_ is 5th in the track listing on **High Violet**, although it is a far darker approach than that heard on _Bloodbuzz Ohio_. It will do nothing to quell the comparisons to Ian Curtis’s **Joy Division**, and their is no doubt some influence taken from them. **Berninger** is in an anxious mood, as he mournfully pleas “_with my kid on my shoulders I try, not to heard anyone I like_“. Whilst it is not too far from the sound achieved on **Boxer**, it is more mature, especially in it’s lyrical content. This track adds further hype to what is already one of the most eagerly anticipated releases of the year.\n\n[Afraid Of Everyone](http://www.mediafire.com/?jmuzmzohjjv)\n\n[Official Site](http://www.americanmary.com/)",
