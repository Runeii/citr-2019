  "body": "Was super into the first couple of tracks from LA’s **GEO**, slick productions that hinted at a solid knowledge of pop songstructures.\n\nHence my excitement at seeing his latest track featured other vocalists for the first time; singer Gabriela Francesca and rapper Rex Mac. Managing to keep his unique production style at the core of the track, _Better_ is another vibrant, accessible number, that hints at GEO really beginning to carve out a niche for himself. Check it out below.",
