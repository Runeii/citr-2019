  "body": "It might be wishful thinking, but it sounds like the haze that’s covered one hell of a lot of musical releases over the last few years might be lifting.\n\nUnderneath that cloying pall we can find the likes of London/Brighton quartet **Novella**, three girls and one boy making a stargazing grungy racket, exemplified by the likes of _Don’t Believe Ayn Rand_, lead track from their forthcoming EP. _…Ayn Rand_ showcases a distinct step forward from the band’s previous releases, sharpening their fidgety beats and roiling distortion, and adding a hook so big it has its own gravitational pull. It’s effortlessly cool, but it’s still kind of approachable.\n\nNovella are due to release their eponymous EP via [Italian Beach Babes](http://italianbeachbabes.bigcartel.com/product/ibb018-novella-ep \"BURNING SKULL RECORDS\") on March 19th. You can find the dates for their March tour with Veronica Falls below.
