  "body": "With SXSW having now been and gone in a blur of beer, tacos and a host of killer performances, the world is starting to settle into normality once more.\n\n One of the hottest talking points of the week was PC Music’s first US shows, featuring performances from numerous members of the collective, including QT, A.G. Cook and GFOTY (alongside this embarrassing for both parties [Huw Stephens interview](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02mrwmt)) – in truth it was less of an explosion of colour and energy, more a sole auto-tuned yelp set against a week of far more interesting music. Now a year on since the finest PC Music related track was first aired, and Hey QT finally has a video, one that no long really comes across either as bizarre or tongue in cheek, more just the PC Music norm. Perhaps my feelings towards the entire project was summed up most succinctly by seeing SOPHIE having his hairspray confiscated at Austin airport security – there’s definitely a metaphor in there somewhere. Anyway, check out the video below, if it’s still your kind of thing.",
