  "body": "There have been some fantastic debut tracks in 2012 so far; with the **Neighbourhood’s** [_Female Robbery_](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14538-new-the-neighbourhood-female-robbery/) and **Family History’s** [_In Need_](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/15579-new-family-history-in-need-demo/) proving particular highlights. The quirkily titled _DREAM3ERS_ from dreampop outfit **EPIC FLING** certainly ranks up there among the best, despite it’s outward slightly self-indulgent appearance. Combining shoegaze inspired guitars with more ethereal, floaty vocals, it’s destined to put **EPIC FLING** on the radars of many bloggers around the world.\n\n<a href=\"http://epicfling.bandcamp.com/track/dream3ers\">DREAM3ERS by EPIC FLING</a>",
