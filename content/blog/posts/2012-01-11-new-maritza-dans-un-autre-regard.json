  "body": "French was never my strong point at school, a fact that I’m sure my teacher would testify to.\n\nHence I have no idea whatsoever about the subject matter of this new track from Montréal’s **MARITZA**, not that it really makes too much difference with music this downright beautiful. _Dans Un Autre Regard_ is a delicate acoustic-styled number, taking in influences such as **Feist** and **Regina Spektor**. The fact I have no idea what **MARITZA** is singing about actually adds to the level of intrigue and mystic; I can’t help but be enchanted.\n\n<a href=\"http://maritza.bandcamp.com/track/dans-un-autre-regard\">Dans un autre regard by MARITZA</a>",
