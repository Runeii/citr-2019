  "body": "Fresh from it’s premiere on Zane Lowe’s BBC Radio 1 show, Rhodes returns with a emphatic piece of anthemic pop.\n\nEntitled ‘Breathe’, the track is the first from Rhodes’ latest EP ‘Home’, due for release on his own Ministry of Sound imprint on the 19th October.\n\nBeginning with a level of fragility, the track suddenly emerges into a flourishing rapture, continuing to build on it’s own effervescent energy. Destined to be a track that many will eagerly await for _that_ moment at festivals, in which the sun is just beginning to set and the night is unbounded with opportunities, ‘Breathe’ positions Rhodes in a strong dynamic for the remainder of 2014.\n\nDetails of his upcoming headline tour can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/rhodesmusicuk/photos/a.563752736972836.147062.558690077479102/897641876917252/?type=1&theater)",
