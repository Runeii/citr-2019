  "body": "Colorado duo **Sunboy** (comprised of Justin Renaud and Jordan Lempe), come about as fully formed as a new artist can be.\n\nTheir debut track, _Anxious People_, is a wonderfully colourful, psychedelic jam, that’s as open to its pop sensibilities, as it is to the lackadaisical, dreamy moments that litter and characterise it. This impressive track, paired with their press shots that are almost a sly dig at the rigid, predictable nature of most promotional techniques, it’s clear that **Sunboy** are primed for the big time, whilst without sacrificing either their sense of humour or their creative ingenuity. Check out _Anxious People_, and hit them up on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sunboy/138659849675443).",
