  "body": "Been sitting on this one for a day or two, letting the rad soak through – **Italian Beach Babes** are onto a winner with these guys, and they’ve been right before (**Mazes**, **Eagulls**, **Dirty Beaches**, **Sealings**).\n\nThese dudes from Brighton did release a tape with the label before, but this new demo removes the jaw from the skull (pardon the metaphor).\n\nShort but sweet, this is the kind of violence that could give a girl a boner. Starting off sounding equal parts garage reverb and thrashing guitars, you could be forgiven for not expecting much from the first 20 seconds. Remember what your mammy said though: don’t judge a book and all that. Let this ruckus into your earholes and set fire to your firstborn thought. That’s all I gotta say. It’s some bloody promising stuff from one of the greatest DIY’s labels out there. If you hadn’t realised by now, these are **Boneyards**.\n\n_You can stream Passed Out below. Then you can download it, and listen to it again. Then show it to your nan._",
