  "body": "The world of hip-hop has blown up at the moment.\n\nFrom the odd ball Tyler the Creator to the slightly more conventionally underground Emay, the combination of beats and rhymes has never been more exciting.  \nIt was predictable however that the release of Fashawn’s new mixtape ‘Higher Learning 2’ would be swamped by Odd Future and their recent TV appearance. What it doesn’t mean however is that the mixtape isn’t worth listening to, because it really fucking is. Full of smart rhymes and inspired beats it could be the best free listen you’ve had in a while. Check it out below.\n\n[Download: Fashawn- Higher Learning 2](http://www.xxlmag.com/uploads/mixtapes/2011.2-Fashawn-higher_learning.zip)",
