  "body": "I’ve been waiting for this moment for well over two months now; a brand new track from New Zealand’s **Unmap**.\n\nSince posting his debut outing [_Trepanning_](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/15175-new-unmap-trepanning/) online (which has recently mysteriously disappeared), I’ve taken to checking his [bandcamp](http://unmap.bandcamp.com/track/etude-no-3-waiting) and [soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/unmap-1) every other day, anticipating his return. Thankfully, _Etude No.3 (Waiting)_ does not disappoint; a myriad of twisted synths and auto-tuned vocals collide in a blissfully delicate fashion, proof that the months of waiting have not been in vain. There’s still no clues as to who the producer is behind this glorious music, but hey, does it really matter? Check out _Etude No.3 (Waiting)_ below.",
