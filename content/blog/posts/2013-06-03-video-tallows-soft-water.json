  "body": "Having witnessed their electrifying live show during SXSW, and then proceeded to embark on a messy night out with the guys, which involved, amongst other things, a dog with a tattoo and a recovering drug addict with a habit of stealing his flatmates prescription meds (long story…), I can safely assure you that **Tallows** deserve to be one of the biggest bands in the world.\n\nCollaborating with choreographers Maggie Boyett and Kathleen McKenna, the band have pieced together this wonderful video for _Soft Water_. With a dozen or so dancers, accompanied by a song that’s as good as any you’ll hear this year, this is more than just a performance video; there’s a genuine connection between the band and the dancers. Check it out below, and keep your ears peeled for their debut LP, expected later this year.",
