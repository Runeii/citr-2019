  "body": "Brainchild and CitR fave, **Onoe Caponoe**, has followed up the release of his _Willows Midnight Gallery LP_ with this playful new video for, _FunkadeliC PlaneT_.\n\n**Caponoe**’s flow is as frustrated as ever, “_Last night I stood up in my bed and watched my body sleep_”, it’s this invigorated, static imagery that forces the young MC to an exciting little cubbyhole of UK hip-hip. Spaced beats, a funky bass-line and a spinning world that Caponoe expertly maneuvers form something we haven’t heard for a while in UK hip-hop.",
