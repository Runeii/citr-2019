  "body": "The collaboration between **DOOM** and **Ghostface killah** (**DOOM/STARKS**) had been a rumour for so long it was starting to wear stale.\n\nBut then shit got interesting. Their label, **Nature Sounds**, have been tweeting recently that news, or at the very least a solid announcement, were just around the corner. For some people it got even more exciting. Certain people who bought the ‘_DOOM x Akomplice box_’ were mailed a limited tape recently, featuring a remix of the album track ‘_victory laps_’.\n\nAlthough not strictly an album track, the recording gives us an exciting insight into what the LP could be like. In many ways it’s what was expected; **DOOM**’s surreal streams of consciousness combined with **Ghost**’s more reality driven witticisms. But just to make one thing clear though: I am not complaining.\n\n [DOOMSTARKS (DOOM x Ghostface Killah) – Victory Laps (Madvillainz Remix) \\[Radio Rip\\]](http://soundcloud.com/djseptember7th/doomstarks-victory-laps-2dope) by [Dj September 7th](http://soundcloud.com/djseptember7th)",
