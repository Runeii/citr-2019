  "body": "It’s been a while since we last checked in with London trio **Halflight**, and boy have they got some super-secret mega-exciting plans in the works.\n\nAnyway, whilst these plans come into fruition, they’ve teased us with a relaunch of their [website](http://www.halflightmusic.com/), alongside new track _Echo_. Easily their most progressive work to date, the track showcases the ear for a catchy pop tune that the lads have. Swirling pianos and booming percussion mark much of _Echo_, coupled with **Cookson’s** sublime vocals to craft something hugely atmospheric and engaging.\n\n[Echo](http://vimeo.com/40539104) from [Halflight](http://vimeo.com/halflightmusic) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
