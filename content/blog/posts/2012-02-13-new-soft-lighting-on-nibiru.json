  "date": "2012-02-13T19:02:03",
  "body": "With this, his fourth track, **Bryan Cox** aka _Soft Lighting_ tries something rather different.\n\nHis previous three efforts to date were quite atypical synth-pop inspired numbers, verging on the dreaded chillwave word, so it’s interesting to hear him take up an entirely instrumental approach on _On Nibiru_. It’s a twisting behemoth of a track, spinning wildly between clunky bass sounds and the disorientating synths, leaving the listener utterly perplexed yet enthralled. Check out _On Nibiru_ below.",
