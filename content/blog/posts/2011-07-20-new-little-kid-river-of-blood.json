The organ in his new track River of Blood for example, was a single note played directly into a microcassette recorder for the duration of the cassette; adjusting the tape’s playback speed then changed the note’s pitch.\n\nAway from the experimentation is a voice and a message that is rooted in classic songwriting, a reverberating acoustic guitars and the most human of voices deliver a moment of pure human introspection.\n\nSteam and download the song below.\n\n<a href=\"http://littlekid.bandcamp.com/track/river-of-blood-2\">River of Blood by Little Kid</a>",
