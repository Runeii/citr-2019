  "body": "Following on from the excellent ‘Children of Desire’ and last year’s ‘Total Nite’, Tampa band [Merchandise](https://www.facebook.com/wmerchandise?fref=ts) have announced that their next album will be released on 4AD, which seems like a match made in heaven.\n\nMerchandise are also streaming their next single, ‘Begging for Your Life/In The City Light’ in advance of a release on limited run of 12″ vinyls on February 24th. The track echoes everything great about Merchandise’s previous records, particularly Carson Cox’s unmistakable vocals. It does however, takes a more laid back approach to previous songs which have felt rooted in punk music. This track features echoes of saxophones, giving the track an almost jazz-like feel about it. 2014 is going to be a big year for this band.\n\nCheck out the [4AD website](http://www.4ad.com/news/14/1/2014/4adwelcomemerchandisedebut12nowavailableforpreorder) for more.\n\n\\[youtube=http://youtu.be/mfbaAesfbTg\\]",
