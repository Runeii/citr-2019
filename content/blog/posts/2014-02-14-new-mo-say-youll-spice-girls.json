  "body": "Remember those Spice Girls photographs that [you could collect](http://www.</p><p>amazon.co.uk/Official-Spice-Girls-Photo-Album/dp/B00872EKCW)? Yeah, I collected those and I’m not ashamed to admit it. Looking back, Emma Bunton was probably my first crush, at the age of five or six. Anyway, it’s refreshing (and somewhat scary – was it really that long ago) to hear a singer who was raised on the girl-group, trying her hand, and nailing, a cover of _Say You’ll Be There_ and it’s somewhat fitting that it comes courtesy of Denmark’s **MØ**.\n\nWhen viewing 2014’s crop of likely female popstars – we’re talking BANKS, Chloe Howl, Say Lou Lou etc, if there’s one who most embodies the ethos that helped to make the Spice Girls so successful, it’s definitely **MØ**. Check out the fantastic cover below, and make sure to pick up her debut LP, No Mythologies To Follow which drops 10 March.",
