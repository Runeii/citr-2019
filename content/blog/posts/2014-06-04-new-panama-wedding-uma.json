  "body": "I feel like I’ve been waiting a long time to post new music from **Panama Wedding**, yet in that time he’s conquered a huge amount of America, with the rest of the world soon to follow.\n\nNew track, _Uma_, shows again his knack for finding a killer hook and addictively catchy vocal line, it’s as much Genesis inspired as it is indebted to modern music, and it’s bloody brilliant. Check it out below. Uma is lifted from Panama Wedding’s debut EP, Parallel Play, out now.",
