Also, this video isn’t recommended for those with an unhealthy crush upon **Lana** (myself), as it shows her getting rather intimate with the aforementioned tattooed guy. As a video, it’s pretty cliched, but hey, what else were we expecting from the new princess of pop?\n\nNB. 1) Is it just me or is Lana retardedly cross-eyed in the clip?\n\n2) Those tigers must have been heavily sedated.",
