  "date": "2014-02-03T23:16:54",
  "body": "Longtime CitR favourite **Jamie Isaac** comes into 2014 off the back of one of last years finest EPs, and new cut _She Dried_ suggests an even more exciting direction for the nineteen year old Londoner.\n\nPinned down by a choppier beat than we’re used to from Isaac, the vocals are stronger, the production is bolder and there’s a much more sensual, dare I say sexual vibe to the track. Check it below.",
