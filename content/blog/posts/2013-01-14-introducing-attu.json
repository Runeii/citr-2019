  "body": "Another CitR post lost somewhere amidst the murky myriads of time, London’s **Attu** introduced to me via Jamie Milton of [Fake DIY](http://www.thisisfakediy.co.uk/articles/news/listen-attu-unveil-debut-collection-of-tracks-stream-b/), is the solo project of Stefan Antoinette (Delta/Alaska). Four tracks, purposefully bizarrely titled A, B, C, and, you guessed it, D. Drawing from the sounds of the likes of **Foals** and **Bloc Party**, there’s touches of post-rock apocalypse (A), through to far more delicate, chorus orientated numbers (B &C). Whilst the production at times could do with being slightly more squeaky clean, **Attu** is one of the most fully formed new acts that I’ve heard in quite some time. Check out the full EP below, and grab a pay-what-you-like download.",
