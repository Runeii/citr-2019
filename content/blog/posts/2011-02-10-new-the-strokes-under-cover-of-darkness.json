The Strokes have finally released their newest single, _“Under Cover Of Darkness”_ from their forthcoming long awaited 4th LP _Angles_. The best part is that it’s free, so before you do anything click [here](http://www.thestrokes.com/download/) to grab it. So far the reaction to the single has been subdued, with most publications choosing to be quiet about their obviously simmering opinions. For those who miss the download, you can grab it off iTunes when it’s released digitally on February 15th, or alternatively, have a listen below.\n\n_Angles will released on March 21st in the UK via **Rough Trade** and March 22nd in the U.S. via **RCA.**_\n\n [The Strokes – Under Cover Of Darkness](http://soundcloud.com/thebluewalrus/the-strokes-under-cover-of-darkness) by [thebluewalrus](http://soundcloud.com/thebluewalrus)",
