  "body": "httpv://www.\n\nyoutube.com/watch?v=A0Dc8DtVxb0\n\nDeptford Goth, the artist known as Daniel Woodhouse, released a video for ‘Feel Real’, a cut from his album. The piece is well put-together, especially as it appears to have a shoestring budget. Even though it doesn’t do anything revolutionary, the ‘Feel Real’ video is a pleasant enough affair and does a good job reflecting the tone of the song.\n\nHis album, _Life After Defo_, was released on the 18th March and you can grab it in the normal places.",
