  "date": "2012-01-18T17:22:02",
  "body": "I can honestly say everything this man does is completely inspired – whether it’s under the name **Grizzly Bear** or **Department Of Eagles**, songwriter **Daniel Rossen** is an expert at his trade.\n\nThat’s probably why **Warp Records** are releasing a solo EP of his work in March, entitled _Silent Hour / Golden Mile_.\n\nThe first track has been released and it’s heartbreaking. There’s something in Rossen’s voice that’s so stripped-back and semi-worried, something like a melancholic **Cat Stevens**, or thereabouts if I had to make a comparison. He’s an essential element to **Grizzly Bear**‘s unique sound – _Yellow House_ is one of my favourite albums of all time, and it wouldn’t have been without his voice and musicianship. If the rest of the material is like this, I know I’m thoroughly looking forward to it.\n\n_Listen to Saint Nothing below_. _Silent Hour / Golden Mile EP is out on March 19th on CD/12″/download via Warp Records_.",
