  "body": "London’s latest hot property, **Tev’n**, couldn’t come across as any more modern sounding if he tried.\n\nFrom the glitchy, sparse beat of _Rose Petal_, a track that seemingly finishes rather abruptly, leaving the listener in suspense, before flowing into _Falling Away_. It’ll be difficult to find a single article on **Tev’n** that doesn’t reference SOHN and/or The Weeknd, yet there’s a more late 90’s / early 00’s feel to his R&B infused style, and, an unconventional comparison it may be, but there’s a certain element of a ‘cooler’ Craig David to Falling Away. Stream both tracks below.",
