With their debut record released to rapturous reviews and their new self titled album split in two parts Puzzle / The Detective released earlier this year, they are the star in the crown of the fantastic **How Is Annie** records. Fusing an intriguing synthesis of post-rock, folk and rock, **YPOFH** create a sound that is both encapsulating and inspiring. _**Crack in the Road**_ were lucky enough to get a few questions answered by drummer Morten.\n\n_Crack in the Road: At the moment the music scene in Norway is arguably as strong as it has ever been, what reasons do you think there are for this?_\n\nI’m not sure exactly how strong it really is, but there are a lot of people playing in bands and expressing themselves through music these days. How well they’re doing is another matter entirely. One of the reasons many scenes are growing in Norway is the financial state of our country. The Norwegian economy is very solid and people are relatively well off. Our basic needs are filled, and more and more people are looking for fulfilment through other aspects of life. Just take a look at out art schools, they’re packed. But although a lot of people are playing music, which is great, there are also people playing music that should never have picked up an instrument. It might seem like a harsh and cocky thing to say, but it’s true, and the sheer number of more or less qualified musicians might be the reason the music scene appears to be strong, I don’t know. For me personally, it’s been a long time since I’ve been amazed by a Norwegian artist, but hey, most Danes don’t think they have any good movie directors either, and they arguably do! And of-course we have the same problem as everywhere else: Business kills, or at least overshadows, good music. Anyway, check out Norwegian acts like Team Me, Monzano, Kråkesølv and Dominic – or old heroes like Catena Collapse and Angora Static.\n\n_Crack in the Road: Would you agree with Sjur Lyseid that the “northern gloominess and melancholy” of Norway has an affect on the music that is produced, both by yourselves and your peers?_\n\nSjur sure has a way with poetic words, doesn’t he? Of course we have polar bears, the midnight sun and northern lights – the latter which we actually made our first record under – way up north in Norway. Still, I think it might be overly romanticized to say that Norwegians are making this extraterrestrial, melancholic, life changing music. That said, when it comes to Youth Pictures of Florence Henderson I think most of the members get an outburst and might act out some negative and darker thoughts through our music. Hopefully our listeners can relate to that. In everyday life we are in fact really cheerful and outgoing human beings – who would have thought! People say melancholy is a Nordic phenomenon, but I think it’s universal. But of course, we know and cherish the fact that we live in an utterly fantastic and beautiful country, and we are not afraid to make references to both the deep, deep fjords and the shimmering northern lights, we just rarely do.\n\n_Crack in the Road: Your debut album sounds very much post-rock inspired, almost to the verge of early 90’s “dream pop”, what were your main inspirations for the new record? Both musically and otherwise?_\n\nOur first album was really inspired by post rock. We listened a lot to bands like Godspeed, Sigur Ros, Explosions in the Sky and Mogwai, while implementing some inspiration from the post hardcore bands like Funeral Diner and City of Caterpillar. On our new record (double album called “Puzzle/The Detective”) we wanted to take the genre a step further and not do the build-up-and-explode-thing that many bands grow stuck doing all over again. On the other hand we didn’t want to lose “our sound” that defined us on the first record. While doing a lot more vocals and more intriguing arrangements, we hopefully managed to bring something new into a genre that many people has grown a little bit tired of. To me, that is defining post rock – doing rock in new shapes, a genre in constant movement. There is no use hiding the fact that some of us also are into that 90s old-school emo thing, which I think also can be easily spotted throughout our latest album. You are not fully human before you have heard Christie Front Drive’s s/t record from 1996! Some reviews have mentioned shoegaze as our genre, but most of us aren’t really into that (except from Slowdive, which we love!). What I know for sure is that the album needs time, and I hope our listeners give us the benefit of the doubt and try it out. Lyrically we are way out, just so you know. We find words and phrases that we love, and puzzle them together so they might, or might not, give some sort of meaning. Like our music the words are fragments of a whole and it’s up to the listener (the detective) to decipher or comprehend them on their own. Single words trigger different emotions with different people and make them remember something they have experienced – both good and bad. It’s not up to us to make the connections, even though we have our own ways of finding meaning into our lyrics. And just to make the puzzle even more complex, the cover of the album is a 32 page art-book made by two friends of ours. Pretentious? Yes… The next album is going to be packed with 3-minute melodic punk rock-tunes.\n\n_Crack in the Road: Who comes up with the fantastic song titles and where does the inspiration come from?_\n\nThe inspiration comes from our northern gloominess, but not from our melancholy. Enough jokes. As said before we just find words and phrases that we think have a certain feel to them. It can be dark, it can be sad, it can be fun, it can be weird. Mainly we want people to start spinning their own stories around them. The inspiration can come from phrases and words we find on the internet, hear on TV, on the radio, read in books or in other bands lyrics. We have pages upon pages with different titles – too bad we’ve got so few songs… We might have song titles for our next 6 albums. Hopefully we never make that many records…\n\n_Crack in the Road: If you had to describe your own sound in three words, what would they be?_\n\nNever-ending: We have long songs. Very long. So long that people never know when we actually change song at concerts.  \nMelodic: We will never lose the good melodies found in our guitars. That is the main ingredient.  \nDetailed: We have details that the listener can discover the 20th time they listen to a song. We like to put a lot of things into our arrangements, so that they almost seem messy at first, but reward the ones who hang in there.\n\n_Crack in the Road:_ _If you could have any super power, what would it be?_\n\nØystein: The power of failing  \nTorbjørn: I’d like to be the Hulk. That way I can always cross the street.  \nMorten: Superpowers are for losers  \nGjermund: The ability to change into any form of paper. That way I could mail myself as a threatening letter and make my escape as a paper airplane when pursued by enemies, just like the greatest supervillain of all time: The Perilous Paper Doll Man.  \nElling: The power of love.  \nAudun: The power of looking exactly like the pink panther. Hey, wait. I already do look exactly like the pink panther! How lucky.  \nAnders: The power of being like E. Davis Ester from the planet Touston.\n\nIf you are around in London on 11th September, head over to The Fighting Cocks in Kingston-upon-Thames to see the first ever UK live date from **Youth Pictures Of Florence Henderson**.\n\n[Check Out Youth Pictures Of Florence Henderson’s Myspace!](http://www.myspace.com/youthpictures)\n\n[Check Out The Facebook Event For Their First UK Gig!](http://www.facebook.com/youthpictures#!/event.php?eid=147712715253853&ref=mf)",
