  "body": "There’s nothing better when writing about new music and stumbling across a project that is already fully coherent.\n\nSo many new artists struggle to link together the music, the tone of the project, the visuals and the general concept behind the entire project – sounds like pretentious bullshit but it makes a huge difference as a blogger to witness a project where every element has been intricately considered. UK musician and animator **Arthr** epitomises this – with his debut EP, **_Reliving of Scenes_**, coming complete with stunning visuals for lead track _Context Unavailable_. Music wise, the influences appear relatively easy to pin down – we’re talking the likes of Boards of Canada, Tycho, maybe even the likes of Bonobo and The Orb as well at moments. Above all, it’s the ambition and artistry that really stand out, and make Arthr such an exciting project. Check out the video below, alongside another track lifted from the release.\n\nLike this?
