  "body": "The first non-Tyler T Williams directed video for **Youth Lagoon**, Stephen McNally’s visuals for _Raspberry Cane_ are strangely in keeping with the poignancy and evocative nature of Williams’s work with the Boise native.\n\nFully animated, and clocking in at just under seven minutes, it’s a startling and utterly unique affair. Born into a fantasy world, where mysterious, majestic animals live side by side with humans, much like the song itself, there’s plenty to marvel at. Check out the video for _Raspberry Cane_ below, lifted from _**Wondrous Bughouse**_, out now on Fat Possum, also keep your eyes peeled for what is surely an animated version of Mr Powers round about the three minute mark.",
