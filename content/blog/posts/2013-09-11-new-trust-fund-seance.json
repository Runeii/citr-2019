  "body": "Bristol’s **Trust Fund** reminds me of .\n\nfun before they sold their souls to the MTV devil, and went under the name The Format. Back when they wrote acoustic songs to be used on The OC, instead of shit-pop to be used in indie nightclubs. So there’s also elements of Nick Drake on _séance, _the new track from **Trust Fund**, but as a composition, it’s so completely immersive that it throws off any negative connotations that may come with being able to effortlessly draw comparisons.",
