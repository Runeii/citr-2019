  "body": "[Snowbird](http://bellaunion.com/artists/snowbird/), Bella Union’s newest signing, includes label boss **Simon Raymonde** alongside the sweet voice of **Stephanie Dosen**. They’ve introduced themselves to the world through _Porcelain_, a quiet and tentative number which sees Dosen’s voice float over pianos and orchestral sounds. This remix by RxGibbs completely changes the ambience of the track. By layering vocals, beats, and echoes of the pianos and strings from the original, the remix expands into a world of sound, incorporating shoe-gaze, dub and folk. Pretty beautiful if you ask me.\n\nTheir debut album, _**Moo**_n, is due for an early 2014 release.\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/121831555″ params=”color=ff6600&auto\\_play=false&show\\_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]",
