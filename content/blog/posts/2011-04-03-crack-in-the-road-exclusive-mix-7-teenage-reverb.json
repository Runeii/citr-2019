Take his two releases so far, ‘Summit Demos’ and ‘Isolation Tape Night’, two collections of music that do their best never to wallow in a particular sound or texture. His work still manages to hold a continuous theme however, the songs invoking a sense of forced delirium, whether **Reverb** is experimenting with chillwave or shoegaze.\n\nHis Mixtape for **Crack in the Road** wears that philosophy on its sleeve, jumping from dreamy instrumental hip-hop to the rather disturbing Rn’B of **The Weeknd**. It’s a great listen and a fantastic addition to our Exclusive mix series. Check out the exclusive mix bellow and why not download his latest mixtape while your at it?\n\n[Crack In The Road Exclusive Mix #7: Teenage Reverb](http://www.mixcloud.com/crackintheroad/crack-in-the-road-exclusive-mix-7-teenage-reverb/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=cloudcast_link) by [Crackintheroad](http://www.mixcloud.com/crackintheroad/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=profile_link) on [Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=homepage_link)",
