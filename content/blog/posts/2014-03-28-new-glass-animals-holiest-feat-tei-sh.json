  "body": "With **Glass Animals** all set to ‘do an Alt-J’ and take over the UK in the coming months, and _Tei Shi_ destined to inherit the alt-pop crown from Grimes, it only makes sense that two of SXSW’s hottest artists should join forces.\n\n_Holiest_ is the perfect amalgamation of both sounds, dreamy, wistful yet delightfully odd and slightly uncompromising at points, it’s one of the tracks of the year thus far.",
