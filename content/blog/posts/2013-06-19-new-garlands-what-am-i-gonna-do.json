  "body": "Brooklyn is arguably the ‘buzz-iest’ city in the world, with artists from all over the world moving to the NY borough, both to be surrounded by like-minded creative individuals, and simply to be able to brand themselves as ‘a Brooklyn based outfit’.\n\n**Garlands**, a relatively new and as yet anonymous group hail from the aforementioned part of the world, and with only two tracks to their name, it’s clear they’re still very much in the embryonic stage. Of the duo of tracks, _What Am I Gonna Do_ is the more immediate, and single-worthy; a slice of Best Coast, 60’s inspired surf-pop, with romantic and melancholic undertones. ‘_If I was sixteen, I would feel the same way, oh there’s nothing in the world that can make me change my ways_‘. Check out What Am I Gonna Do below.",
