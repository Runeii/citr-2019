The record is managing to achieve critical and commercial success, gaining fans such as **Thurston Moore** and **Bill Murray**; not bad for a first LP.\n\n_‘When I’m With You’_ is the highlight for many. Full of beautiful harmonies and low-fidelity fuzz, it captures perfectly the painful innocence of the album. So here it is for you to enjoy/re-enjoy, depending on your persuasion.",
