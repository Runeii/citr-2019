  "body": "Having caused quite a stir with a trio of tracks in 2014, UK duo **Fantastic Fantastic** (Kris Small and Mickemon Lindebergh) return with their most colourful offering yet, in the form of _Boulevard_.\n\nAnother slice of ready for festivals synth-pop, moving further away from the Jungle comparisons that sat heavy on their first offerings, there’s far more 80’s to this than anything else – no tricks, just expertly pop music. In their own words, Boulevard is “_basically about the ability to travel and write at the same time._” and features as the A-side to the previously heard The Night, out now through their own imprint. Check it out below.",
