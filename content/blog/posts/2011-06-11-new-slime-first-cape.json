On **June 27** the much-hyped South London producer will have shown all his cards, but for now we’ll have to make do with his new track, _First Cape_. It’s an awkward little tune; it pops with an uncontrolled melancholy, with the haunting vocals and low-fi clarinet tones sounding unimagined and flat. Yet despite all this, it finds a grace and fluidity in the mangled and mismatched snippets of sadness, ultimately it finds hope. Listen Below.\n\n [Slime – First Cape](http://soundcloud.com/slime-music/first-cape) by [Slime Music](http://soundcloud.com/slime-music)",
