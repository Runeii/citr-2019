Now what this scene would need is a band to tread the path, and York quartet The Howl & The Hum are a mighty contender for the crown. Their debut EP, _Godmanchester Chinese Bridge_ is just the right amounts of accessible yet still unerringly cool and ’emotional’. Lead single and title track is one of this years finest debut offerings, lyrically poignant and instrumentally elegant. Check it out below, alongside recent single, _Terrorforming_.",
