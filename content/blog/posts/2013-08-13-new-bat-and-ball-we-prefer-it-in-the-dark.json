  "body": "A five piece hailing from London, fronted by brother/sister duo Chris and Abi Sinclair, **Bat and Ball** have been around for a couple of years now, but appear to have just about found their sound on new track _We Prefer It In The Dark_.\n\nSure to draw comparisons to the likes of CHVRCHES, WPIITD is centred around a choppy beat and the moody vocals of Abi Sinclair. Check it out below, and keep up with the five piece on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/batandballband).",
