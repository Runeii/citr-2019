  "body": "**Goodbye Chanel** couldn’t sound less British if they tried.\n\nHaving started life as the solo project of Scott Johnson, GC has blossomed into a five piece, which has hugely benefitted their live shows in particular. With 2013’s EP _**Through Night To Paradise**_ gaining them fans up and down the country, they’re set to follow it up with a second EP, **_Hot City Nights_**, out in April on [Dead Young](https://www.facebook.com/deadyoungrecords). The first single to be lifted from said EP comes in the form of _Foreva_, another slice of languid, dreamy pop, drifting in somewhere between Wild Nothing and Craft Spells. Stream it below.",
