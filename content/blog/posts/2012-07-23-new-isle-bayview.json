  "body": "Having impressed with their couple of debut demos, Pensacola’s **Isles**, now known as **Isle**, have unveiled their first complete recording.\n\nRevamping the chillwave inspired _Bayview_ into a more folk influenced number, there’s extra dimensions added with the backing vocals and a generally more languid atmosphere throughout, ending up sounding more **Fleet Foxes** than **Washed Out** in truth. Despite the slight change in direction, it’s still very much the **Isle(s)** that I prompted me to write about them in the first place, and I for one am not complaining.",
