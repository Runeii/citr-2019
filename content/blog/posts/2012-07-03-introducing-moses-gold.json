  "body": "Despite what the mainstream press would have you believe, there’s far more going on in Manchester than four lairy lads prancing about on stage, performing karaoke style renditions of worn out hits, to a field of 60,000 Stella Artois swilling geezers.\n\nIn fact, with the likes of **PINS**, **M O N E Y** and **G R E A T W A V E S** (not forgetting the emergence of **SWAYS**) beginning to spread their wings outside of the UK, there’s actually many reasons to respectfully let the past smoulder whilst these exciting new artists carry the flaming torch for what is now a very different Manchester.\n\nAnother such act who will undoubtedly begin to attract deserved recognition is **Moses Gold**, a previous member of the controversial **Christian AIDs** and **Stay +** collaborator. His debut outing _Luvsick_, accompanied by the beautifully shot video below, harks back to the likes of **Bauhaus**, **The Sound** and of course, **Joy Division**, with it’s moody atmosphere and epic crescendo, yet brought into a more modern perspective. It’s the sound of anxiety, paranoia and despairing shame, and **Moses Gold** brings it to life.\n\nWith _Luvsick_ featuring on numerous blogs and a steady trail of ‘buzz’ being left in his wake, **Moses Gold** has announced the details of his first ever live show on 30 August at Manchester’s Soup Kitchen alongside **Esben and the Witch**, **Leopard of Honour** and a very special guest. Whilst I can’t divulge any more information than that, let me assure you that it’s well worth staying enthusiastic about. So, if you’re still to be convinced about where Manchester will go from here, **Moses Gold** may well prove to be your leader.\n\n[Tickets here](https://www.wegottickets.com/event/176029).
