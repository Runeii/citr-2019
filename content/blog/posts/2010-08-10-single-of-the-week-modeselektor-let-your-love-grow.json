Since the release of the Berlin duo’s first album in 2005, _‘Hello Mom!’_ the techno duo have been going from strength to strength, collaborating with **Thom Yorke** and **Maxïmo Park** for their second LP _‘Happy Birthday!’_ Full of absorbing grooves and a sly sense of humour, the record had any electronic music fan on his knees in appreciation.\n\nAlthough undoubtedly rooted in techno, _‘Happy Birthday!’_ had an altogether more ambient sound. _‘Let your love grow’_ was a great example of this, perfect in pacing and delicately produced; the tune is a delight. This is why over three years later it’s our record of the week.\n\n[Check Out Modeselektor’s Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/mdslktr)",
