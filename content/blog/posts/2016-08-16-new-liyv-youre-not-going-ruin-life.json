  "body": "I’m a sucker for a sad song.\n\nSometimes it can be all to easy to wallow in the regret that surrounds the end of a relationship, thankfully in the case of this new track from Seattle’s **Liyv**, it’s the absolute opposite. Instead of what ifs and maybes, it’s a middle finger stuck up to an abusive, calculating, manipulating and careless partner. Tear up the photographs, block their number and throwaway their shitty clothes; you deserve more than that, I deserve more than that – _You’re Not Going to Ruin My Life_.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
