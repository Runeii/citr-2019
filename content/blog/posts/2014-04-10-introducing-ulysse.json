  "body": "Belgian trio **ULYSSE** combine a whole myriad of influences into their debut EP, U as in ULYSSE.\n\nFrom the Klaxons meets MGMT groove of _Wounds_, to the King Krule-esque drawl of _Voodoo Romance_, passing through the almost Alex Turner inspired delivery on _Thunder_. It’s an EP grounded amongst it’s electronic leanings, yet seemingly drawing from a host of other sources, ultimately ending up with a listen that’s as immersing as it is endearingly disjointed.",
