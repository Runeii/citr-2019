  "body": "Perth rapper **Ziggy** certainly makes quite the mark on his debut EP, **_Black Thoughts_**.\n\nStylistically Drawing from the likes of Kendrick and Pusha, it pulls no punches – with several references to Lamar dropped throughout the three track release. EP highlight, _White Lies_, is four minutes of expertly constructed lyrical truths, and unashamedly in your face. Check it below.\n\nLike this?
