  "body": "Delighted to hear that New Zealand duo **French For Rabbit** are set to release their debut album, _**Spirits**_, through one of my favourite labels, Lefse Records.\n\nLead single, Woke Up To A Storm is an orchestral beauty, combining the near-mythical grandeur of Beach House with a folkier edge, more akin to Laura Marling. Having finally got round to watching Moonrise Kingdom the other night, I can’t help but feel like this would have been the perfect closing credits track. With a host of European tour dates coming up (after the track), and the album expected towards the end of October, from here, the only way is up. Check out Woke Up To A Storm below, and pre-order [here](http://lefserecords.limitedrun.com/products/532805-french-for-rabbits-spirits-pre-order).",
