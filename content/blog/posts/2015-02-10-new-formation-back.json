  "body": "London duo **Formation** are getting rather good at this.\n\nTheir debut EP, released last year, saw them doing things slightly different, avoiding the usual straight to Soundcloud / Spotify route, instead pushing everything through a Youtube channel. Now, having made their live debut, and with a run of shows around Europe coming up, they’ve released their latest track, Back Then, a more expansive, yet still disco inspired number – deliriously energetic and their most over the top outing to date. Back Then is taken from the Young Ones EP, out [23 March](http://roughtrade.com/artists/39569).",
