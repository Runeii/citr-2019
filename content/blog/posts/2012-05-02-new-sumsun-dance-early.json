  "body": "The music of **Judson Rogers**‘ alias, **[Sumsun](http://sumsun.bandcamp.com/)**, has been a project that has managed to avoid my radar, well, either his music is avoiding me or my radar is shit. Take your pick. Regardless, he has an EP due out, simply entitled **_2012 EP_**, with the first tune from the 4-song record now streaming on his bandcamp. It’s a feel-good, ethereal house cut to the very core, complete with a funk filled bass-line that cuts deep into the hip.\n\nStream **_Dance Early_** below, and head back to his [bandcamp](http://sumsun.bandcamp.com/) soon to hear the full thing.",
