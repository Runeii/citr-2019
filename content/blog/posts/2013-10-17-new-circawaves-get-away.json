  "date": "2013-10-17T14:48:03",
  "body": "**Circawaves** have been an industry buzz band for the past few months, with their name cropping up all over the shop without actually having officially released a single note of music.\n\nWith _Get Away_, they explode onto the scene, with their infectious brand of The Libertines meets mid-00’s guitar pop. It’s not quite enough to have me as excited as Zane Lowe, who proclaimed it Hottest Record in the World, but it’s certainly a promising first step forward.",
