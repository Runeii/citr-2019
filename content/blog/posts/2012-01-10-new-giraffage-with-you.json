Either way, which ever side you perceive it to fall on, it’s seductive powers have already begun to lull me into an intoxicating sleep. Breath it.\n\n_‘Frolicking through fields with the one that you love on an overcast day.’_\n\n [With You](http://soundcloud.com/giraffage/with-you) by [Giraffage](http://soundcloud.com/giraffage)",
