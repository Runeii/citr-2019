  "body": "With **[Swim Deep](http://soundcloud.com/swimdeep)**‘s debut, (I think), single out in a matter of weeks, the band have dropped the single’s b-side. I’m going to go out on a limb and say, I actually like it more than the _King City_**.** It’s a remarkably more somber affair, sprinkles of organ elevate the track, with the **line “_you’ll never know what love is_”** avoiding the cliché and settling more comfortably in the realms of ‘understatedly moving’. A much better realm if you ask me.\n\n_Beach Justice_ is the B-side to _King City_ out May 14th.",
