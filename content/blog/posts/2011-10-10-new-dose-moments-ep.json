  "body": "This new EP from Columbus beat maker **Dose** is a gloriously ethereal affair, mixing an eclectic variety of influences.\n\nFrom the **Sinead O’Connor** sampling _The Young & The Restless_, to the multi-layered vocal splicing found on _All The Beauty And Wonder_; it’s a sleekly romantic composition. The sounds are spacious and harmonious, allowing the record to breathe wondrously within it’s vast sonic surroundings. It’s unashamedly ‘chillwave’ inspired, however far more soulful than that dreaded tag may suggest. Check out _The Young & The Restless_ below, and head over to the **Dose** [bandcamp](http://dose82.bandcamp.com/) for a free download of _**Moments**_.\n\n<a href=\"http://dose82.bandcamp.com/track/the-young-the-restless\">The Young &amp; The Restless by Dose</a>",
