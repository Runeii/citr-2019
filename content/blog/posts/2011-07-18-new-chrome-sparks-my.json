  "body": "After releasing a combination of singles and remixes, **Chrome Sparks** dropped his new, fully original EP today.\n\nAfter coming relatively out of nowhere, it surprises as well as delivers when it comes to hip jerking, complex electro. **Jeremy Malvin** (Sparks) actually hooks up with blog favourite, **Steffaloo**, on two of the EP’s tracks. She gives the whole things a new dimension, combining with the stumbling and sharp beats to create something altogether more mellow and sedated. As a whole, the EP could be that much needed collection of summer jams.\n\nStream and download the EP below.\n\n<a href=\"http://chromesparks.bandcamp.com/album/my-3\">My &lt;3 by Chrome Sparks</a>",
