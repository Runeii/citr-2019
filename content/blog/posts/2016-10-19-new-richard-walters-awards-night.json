  "date": "2016-10-19T19:40:24",
  "body": "Known for his work as one fifth of Liu Bei, as well as offering his production skills to the likes of CitR favourite Grace Lightman, **Richard Walters** is also a reassuringly confident songwriter in his own right.\n\nHis latest album, A.M., released earlier this month, is a sparkling collection of deeply sincere, at times heart-wrenching tracks, with _Awards Night_, featured below, being a highlight. Elements of Youth Lagoon, Keaton Henson and Elliott Smith shine through in the songwriting, yet it manages to come across as uniquely his own. Check out Awards Night below.",
