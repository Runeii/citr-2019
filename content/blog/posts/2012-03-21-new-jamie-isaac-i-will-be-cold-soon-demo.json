  "date": "2012-03-21T14:36:02",
  "body": "Someone please explain to me how **Jamie Isaac** isn’t a household name yet? With a stunning collection of tracks made available in 2011, and a couple of tasters already out this year ahead of his debut EP release, it’s growing increasingly apparent that this kid has talent in abundance.\n\nNew demo _I Will Be Cold Soon_ is an elegant ballad, with touches of **Perfume Genius** and (dare I say it) **James Blake**, swirling majestically throughout. The melancholic piano resounds knowingly, whilst **Isaac’s** vocals drown in a sea of stirring reverb. Check it out below.",
