  "body": "Mixed gender duos are all the rage at the moment, from Purity Ring, to Beach House, not forgetting Alunageorge, there’s no doubting that two-pieces are ‘cool’.\n\nAsher Levitas (of **Old Apparatus**) and Norwegian musician and vocalist Linn Carin Dirdal have added their name to an ever growing list of musical duos, with the formation of their new outfit, **Saa**. Their newest track, Your Sword Is My Silence, is a resplendent, atmospheric affair, pirouetting cautiously through sleek, over-emphasised vocals and a pronounced rhythm section. Never quite giving in to it’s Cocteau Twins inspiration, and unfurling into an epic anthem, **Saa** prefer to toy with the minimal and the spacious beauty that they conjure up.\n\nYour Sword Is Your Silence is out 8 July on prestigious London label Left Blank.",
