  "body": "Epic tracks are difficult to write and almost impossible to record.\n\nThere’s the danger of them sounding over-exhausted and abrasively impersonal (see everyone’s favourite alcoholic red necks **Kings of Leon**), yet Ireland based outfit **Hush War Cry** may well have just found the winning formula on their new track _Lily_. Opening as a sombre, piano driven ballad, before opening into an expansive chorus heavy number, it’s unstructured yet clearly extremely planned. The vocals are at times slightly strained, but the addition of the female sections maintains the epically melancholic vibe. Stream and download _Lily_ below.\n\n<a href=\"http://hushwarcry.bandcamp.com/track/lily\">Lily by Hush War Cry</a>",
