  "body": "This debut track from the UK’s very own **Big Cosmos** sort of sounds like **White Lies** on acid, or **Friendly Fires** on chlorpromazine.\n\nIt’s electronic dreampop are it’s utmost epic, complete with vaguely mysterious vocals and lyrics _\\-‘your diamonds eyes are alight tonight’_ and _‘through the millions of years, there’s a history of tears, that collect in our bones, cells and our souls.’_ being aptly fitting examples. So the production isn’t quite as slick as some of their contemporaries, but it’s certainly promising. Check out _Pathfinder_ below.",
