  "body": "Brooklyn’s **FRAME** (Caitlin Frame) cropped up towards the beginning of the year, with her debut outing _Run Around_, a Fleetwood Mac indebted power-pop number, that for some reason (my own laziness, most likely) slipped under my radar.\n\nWith a new track premiering on [DIY](http://www.thisisfakediy.co.uk/articles/neu/this-week-in-new-music-12th-april-2014/) last week, she’s well and truly forced her way back into my field of vision, and really clicked this time. New cut, _Polarizer_ feels hugely Blondie influenced, alongside the likes of The Pretenders and The B-52’s; two and a half minutes, straight to the point, yet endearingly glamorous pop. These two tracks alone indicate an electrifying live show.",
