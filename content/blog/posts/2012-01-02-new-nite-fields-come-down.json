  "date": "2012-01-02T01:07:37",
  "body": "With their first non-live track, Brisbane trio **NITE FIELDS** show exactly what they’re capable of creating with the brooding stomp of _Come Down_.\n\nHeavy and languid, it recalls memories akin to the likes of **Jesus & Mary Chain**, as well as touches of **The Horrors** recent shoegaze influenced material. Whilst **NITE FIELDS** may not be a household name yet, if they continue to conjure up pieces with as much composure and maturity as _Come Down_, then there’s no reason why 2012 can’t be their year.\n\n_Come Down_ is released via **Lost Race Records** on 9 January, limited to 150 copies.\n\n [Come Down](http://soundcloud.com/nitefields/come-down-5) by [NITE FIELDS](http://soundcloud.com/nitefields)",
