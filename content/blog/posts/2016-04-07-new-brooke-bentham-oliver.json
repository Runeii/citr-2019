  "body": "Covered **Brooke Bentham’s** debut offering back in 2014; and the North East singer-songwriter has been rather quiet since then.\n\nNow, with the traces of her previous tracks removed from the internet, as is so often the case, she’s re-emerging with an exquisite new number; _Oliver_. Again, showcasing a vocal that rivals pretty much any around at this moment in time, it’s hopefully the start of more releases to come. Check it out below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
