There’s still a lot to look forward to when it comes to the world of **Blake** however. His new EP, **_Enough Thunder_**, is out next month on **Atlas** and this new cut is a promising representation of what’s to come. It’s a slow, drawn out and somber piece of music. It’s a piece of music that calls out for recognition and support, with **Blake**’s vocals sounding more and more like **Jeff Buckley** as times moves along. Stream the BBC rip below and check back to CITR next month for a review of the EP.",
