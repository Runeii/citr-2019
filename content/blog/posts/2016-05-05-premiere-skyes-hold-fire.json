  "body": "Brooklyn trio **SKYES** are set to release their new EP tomorrow, off the back of a successful SXSW which saw them play two official showcases, alongside opening for band of the moment X Ambassadors.\n\nFormed on a drive from New York to LA, the three piece (Dallin, Dan and Artie) craft atmospheric, energetic synth-pop, drawing from a host of 80’s influences combined with more modern, slicker production styles. Their latest offering lifted from the Quarks EP, _Hold Your Fire_, is an anthemic, ambitious, CHVRCHES-esque pop number, centred around a bulging synth line and Dallin’s alluringly delivered vocals; clocking in at an impressive six minutes yet still proving utterly captivating. Check it out below and pre-order the EP [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/quarks-ep/id1084819467).\n\nLike this?
