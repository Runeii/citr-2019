  "body": "Adore this debut single from Swedish duo **ViVii**, just released through Dumont Dumont (Charlie Cunningham, RY X, amongst others).\n\nLifted from an EP expected in May, _Siv (You and I)_ is a glorious slice of ethereal pop, penned about a babysitter the duo knew. The dual vocals intertwine elegantly throughout, most notably on the transcendental chorus; one of the finest I’ve heard for quite some time. Check it out below.",
