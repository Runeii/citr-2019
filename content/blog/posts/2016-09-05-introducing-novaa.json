  "body": "Emerging singer / producer **NOVAA** cropped up on my radar a few months back with a brilliant collaboration EP with Moglii – and is now stepping out solo with her most complete sound to date.\n\nGradually dropping tracks from a nine track EP titled _Stolen Peaches_ expected at the end of September, her take on Purity Ring meets Lorde-esque electro-pop is utterly unique and addictive. Super slick production, and a vocal to die for, all bundled up with one of the most coherent visual aesthetics around, NOVAA has all the makings of an artist to truly believe in. Simply put, these are emotionally fraught, twisted pop songs – and they’re absolutely brilliant. Check out _SEX_ and _HANDS_ below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
