  "date": "2011-11-10T22:33:33",
  "body": "This particular Bavarian beat tailor has used some great samples in the past (including one great bit of dialogue from the Pulp Fiction character Mr Wolf) but this time around has chosen the voluptuous tones of beautiful **Beyoncé**.\n\nHe utilises R’n’B carefully and conservatively, and constructs pure blissful brilliance with those elements. I first heard this guy collaborate with **TOKiMONSTA** and **Lunice** (with a little help from **HudMo**) for Red Bull Music Academy last summer on the track _Alpenglow_, which despite being a one-off, was certainly an addictive track.\n\nIn this new one, he characteristically puts the vocals in the intro, but then uses the melody throughout, and uses quiet moments to great effect. The synths become ghostly, the sampling popping up as if **Swede:art** is merely scanning through talk radio channels. The haunting sitar appears mid-way and adds to the mysteriousness of it all. Can’t wait to hear more from this guy – his debut last year, _Emotional Colours_, is not something I’ve yet sunk my teeth into, but I think I might just treat myself. And so should you.\n\n_Listen to I Don’t Really Wanna Please U below._",
