  "title": "New: Wolf Alice – Blush",
  "date": "2013-09-09T21:16:20",
  "body": "With each and every track they release, Wolf Alice are becoming more and more self-assured.\n\nNew cut Blush is a beautiful, really Sonic Youth / Smashing Pumpkins inspired number, focusing on the stunning vocals of lead singer Ellie Rowsell, building into a grunge driven sonnet. Whilst the predicted guitar revival hasn’t quite perhaps taken off this year as expected, Wolf Alice are one of the few highlights of ‘indie’ bands in 2013, and are sure to be leading the way into next year.",
