  "date": "2017-03-16T16:07:17",
  "body": "Garren’s soul flavoured _There She Go_ is the perfect way to see in Spring.\n\nSmokey and mysterious whilst very much reliant on a groove heavy beat the track ticks a lot of boxes in regards to popular current trends in R&B. There She Go is infectious from start to finish thanks to Garren’s production with the modulated lead guitar and synths taking control allowing the vocals to float in and out where fit. Check the track out below.",
