The general obscurity of Ghibli’s music lends well so his ‘status’, however this most likely won’t last for long. The album is a breath of fresh air, taking influences from house, techno and ambient beat music he’s created an album that almost interpretively blends sounds and styles. There’s an inspiringly organic quality to the work as well, the textures and sounds breathe with a ‘real recording’ tone, sporting a life that some electronic music simply lacks. Download it below.\n\n<a href=\"http://ghibli.bandcamp.com/album/pythia\">Pythia by Ghibli</a>",
