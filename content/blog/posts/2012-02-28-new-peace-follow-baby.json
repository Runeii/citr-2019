  "body": "The UK’s latest buzzband, **Peace** are rapidly gathering quite a fanbase, and their latest track, _Follow Baby_ is sure to bolster their current success.\n\nHeavy than previous outings and centered around a dramatic guitar riff, it’s cinematic in atmosphere yet almost feels ‘lad-rockesque’ at times; a trait that personally I’m not overly keen on. Anyway, it’s perfect for live shows, and serves to cement the group as one of 2012’s most exciting new acts.",
