  "body": "There’s been much made of the so called ‘shoegaze revival’ in recent years, with the likes of **The Twilight Sad**, **The Horrors** and **The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart** attempting to write a modern translation of the echo laden vocals and reverb doused guitars that stereotyped the late 80’s.\n\nWhilst there were some valiant efforts (see _**Primary Colours**_), there was still an underlying feeling that they lacked a true understanding of the creative ethos that made shoegaze such an emotionally inspiring genre.\n\nTake one listen to the riff on **Mentalease’s** _Thoughts Seize_ and you’ll soon realize that **Spencer Harris** doesn’t just sympathize with the groundings of the genre; it’s practically a second language to him. It’s a riff that I’m sure **My Bloody Valentine** would be proud of, and that is truly the highest accolade anyone can offer a shoegaze fanatic. **_Entropy Rising_**, the debut five track release from **Mentalease**, the solo project of the aforementioned **Spencer Harris** is a glorious collection of tracks, and one of the finest EP’s I’ve heard in several years.\n\nElsewhere on the release there’s the sultry drone of _Sleep Paralysis_, the soundtrack to a dream you never had, and the vicious drive of opener _Levitate_, a track that’s both expansive yet wonderfully intimate. Backing female vocals lapse in and out across the course of the five tracks, adding a stunning level of inner conflict. It’s clear that these are extremely personal songs, yet by fashioning them in such a splendid way, **Mentalease** has allowed everyone a peak inside his world.\n\nCheck out my personal favourites below, _Thoughts Seize_ and _Sleep Paralysis_, then head over to the **Mentalease** bandcamp to grab the whole EP for free.",
