  "body": "Much like [Jimmy Napes](www.</p><p>crackintheroad.com/music/30599-new-jimmy-napes-give), **Alex Burey** is a name that seems to have been drifting around for a eternity, and now he’s coming good on early suggested potential. His first two offering, Inside World and Unspoken combine the elegance of Beach House with the composure and lyricism of a 60’s crooner, poignant and gorgeously textured. His latest track, The Intimidator, the lead released from his forthcoming EP, **_Inside World_**, out 9 Feb, is a more psychedelic journey, whilst maintaining the Scott Walker vibes of his early work.",
