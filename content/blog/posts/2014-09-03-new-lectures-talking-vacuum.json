With an [album/extended EP](http://lectures.bandcamp.com/album/morning-come-quickly) of sorts released last year, which definitely has it’s moments (_Uncall_ especially), they’ve returned with their cleanest and most complete track to date in the form of the epic _Talking In A Vacuum_, mixing despairingly honest lyricism, with the sort of epic build that post-rock bands the world over would kill for. This is (at times) the sort of epic songwriting that has A&Rs dreaming of main stage festival slots, and without disrespecting their previous material, this almost feels like a band taking a deep breath, and stepping back out in the world, fresh faced and ready to go. Check out Talking In A Vacuum below, alongside Uncall.",
