  "body": "Having impressed with his debut single, Pillow Talk, towards the latter stages of 2014, London’s **Chris Cookson** is back with his second offering, the beautifully melodic _Sophia_.\n\nAgain showcasing a knack for penning a killer hook, alongside an addictive, memorable chorus, it’s drenched in nostalgia and a sense of yearning for love and days gone by. Mixing modern R&B style inspirations, with the sort of electronic production usually associated with the likes of SOHN or Chet Faker, it’s a diverse sound, whilst remaining inherently pop at heart. Check it out below, alongside Pillow Talk.",
