  "body": "Hotly tipped Manchester four piece **PINS** may only have a few recorded tracks to their name, but that hasn’t stopped them gaining high profile festival slots, and even spreading their fragile wings into Europe.\n\nWith their ferocious sound and 70’s grunge inspired appearances, it comes across like a lovelorn continuation of the riot grrrl scene; dark, obsessive and creatively expressive. Check out their new live video for _You Don’t Need To Be_ below, directed by Sing J Lee.\n\n[WeArePins.co.uk](http://www.wearepins.co.uk/)",
