  "body": "Alongside **M O N E Y** and **Jamie Isaa**c, the North East’s very own **Ajimal** does disconsolate melancholy as well as anyone in the UK.\n\nHaving impressed on the pages of CitR before, it’s fantastic to have him back, with new track _This Human Joy_, a swirling, intoxicating number, that showcases the majestic, pensive side to **Ajimal**. For a song so sombre, it’s ultimately rather uplifting, and one of the finest tracks of 2013 thus far. Check it out below.
