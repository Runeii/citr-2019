  "body": "Hailing from Holland, 17 year old producer **ORIG∆MI** creates luscious, ethereal soundscapes; part **M83**, part **Washed Out**.\n\nTrawling the internet, there is little evidence of** ORIG∆MI’s** existence at all, aside from a couple of blogs posts and his own [bandcamp](http://ori-gami.bandcamp.com/album/the-rapture-ep) page. His debut EP, **_The Rapture_** was released in mid July and is a promising collection of electro-pop inspired tracks, complimented by the vocals of the young composer. The **Toro Y Moi** sampling track _Your Advice_ is the most upbeat of the four; and there will undoubtedly be those labeling his music as chillwave, given it’s lo-fi tendencies and pronounced beats. EP opener _Stendhal Syndrome_ does exactly what the title says, proving melancholic yet wholly euphoric. The immense beauty portrayed in parts of the composition of _**The Rapture**_ show just how exciting a prospect **ORIG∆MI** truly is, and I have no doubt this won’t be the last time Beau Manancourt graces the pages of _**CitR**_. _**The Rapture**_ is available via the **ORIG∆MI** [bandcamp](http://ori-gami.bandcamp.com/album/the-rapture-ep) on a pay-what-you-like basis.",
