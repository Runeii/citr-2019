  "body": "Idiot Glee’s 2011 debut LP _**Paddywhack**_ went somewhat under the radar for most people, and rather unfairly so to tell the truth.\n\nWhilst it perhaps felt slightly emotionally disjointed at times, it still showcased **James Friley** as one of the most naturally talented songwriters around. Fast forward two years, and Friley clearly hasn’t lost that ability, as demonstrated by his fantastic new track _Pinkwood;_ a sultry, almost bluesy-R&B style number. Arguably the best track I’ve heard in the opening few weeks of this year, hopefully _Pinkwood_ will open up the music of **Idiot Glee** to the audience that it so clearly deserves. (Thanks to [IAmNoSuperman](http://iamnosuperman.com/) for the embed and MTV Hive for the [premiere](http://www.mtvhive.com/2013/01/18/idiot-glee-pinkwood/).)\n\n_I think I need a lover_",
