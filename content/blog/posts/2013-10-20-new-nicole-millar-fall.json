  "body": "**Nicole Millar’s** debut solo track, [_Lionheart_](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/22668-new-nicole-millar-lion-heart/), caught my attention earlier in the year, and she’s not back, with new single, teaming up with UK duo **CRVVKS** on production duties. Whilst with her last outing I downplayed the ‘chillwave’ element to her music, Fall brings back some of the blog-friendly vibes, creating something that’s between the elegance of **BANKS**, and the glitchy goodness of **Steffaloo**. Check out Fall below.",
