Unfortunately he’s yet to post any cliched lyrics or [meme’s featuring Xzibit](http://media.photobucket.com/image/yo%20dawg%20obama/MUSE_1/yo-dawg-hope-dawg.jpg \"Yo dawg I heard you like Obama\").\n\nThe Spotify announcement came with a playlist of “a few of Obama’s favorites” alongside tracks picked by campaign staff. Although it doesn’t say which specific tracks were picked by Obama, I like to imagine him sat in the Whitehouse smoking a Marlboro & blasting out the Arcade Fire’s  “We Used To Wait” from the Presedential stereo.\n\n**The Official Obama 2012 Spotify playlist:**  \nRaphael Saadiq, “Keep Marchin’”  \nNoah And The Whale, “Tonight’s The Kind Of Night”  \nBruce Springsteen, “We Take Care Of Our Own”  \nZac Brown Band, “Keep Me In Mind”  \nAretha Franklin, “The Weight”  \nU2, “Even Better Than The Real Thing”  \nRicky Martin, “The Best Thing About Me Is You (feat. Joss Stone)”  \nDierks Bentley, “Home”  \nRay LaMontagne, “You Are The Best Thing”  \nEarth Wind And Fire, “Got To Get You Into My Life (Live)”  \nBooker T & The MG’s, “Green Onions”  \nWilco, “I Got You”  \nThe Impressions, “Keep On Pushing”  \nDreamgirls Soundtrack: Jennifer Hudson, “Love You I Do”  \nAgesandAges, “No Nostalgia”  \nSugarland, “Stand Up”  \nAl Green, “Let’s Stay Together”  \nDarius Rucker, “This”  \nArcade Fire, “We Used To Wait”  \nFlorence And The Machine, “You’ve Got The Love”  \nJames Taylor, “Your Smiling Face”  \nREO Speedwagon, “Roll With The Changes”  \nSugarland, “Everyday America”  \nDarius Rucker, “Learn To Live”  \nElectric Light Orchestra, “Mr. Blue Sky”  \nMontgomery Gentry, “My Town”  \nNo Doubt, “Different People”  \nLedisi, “Raise Up”\n\nSocial media was prevalent in [Obama’s 2008 presidential Campaign](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/business/media/10carr.html \"Obama and Social Media in 2008\") and experts are suggesting he’ll need to harness the power of the people once again in the run up to the [2012 elections](http://www.webpronews.com/note-to-2012-presidential-candidates-your-social-media-presence-is-a-big-deal-2011-11). With accounts on over 15 of the big social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter and Google+, Obama’s web presence either demonstrates the importance of politicians engaging with the people or his press team just have nothing better to do.",
