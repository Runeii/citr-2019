  "date": "2016-08-07T17:38:53",
  "body": "Can’t believe it’s been the best part of two years since we heard from London five piece **Bat and Ball**.\n\nTheir much welcome return comes alongside news of their debut LP, expected out in October, preceded by the hugely ambition lead single Cruel Cats. Merging elements of the likes of Purity Ring and Grimes with a more conventionally pop edge, it’s frenetic stuff and utterly addictive. Check out Cruel Cats below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
