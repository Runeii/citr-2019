  "body": "This post almost escalated into a full length gripe about major labels (specifically in this case, Sony) pulling content from Soundcloud, in order to try to re-monetise / control their digital content.\n\nWhilst it perhaps works for larger, already established artists, to underappreciate the role of Soundcloud as a promotional tool when building new aritsts is seemingly rather naive, especially when considering no Soundcloud = no Hype Machine. Anyway, back to the music.\n\nGlasgow outfit **WHITE** have built quite a reputation over the past few months for their high octane live shows, and last weekend’s Great Escape Festival certainly saw them emerging as one of the most talked about new acts. Having signed to Sony for their debut single proper, _Future Pleasures_, the five piece are Scotland’s most exciting new band right now. Fitting the mould of mid-00’s indie disco, we’re talking Franz Ferdinand, The Rakes, dare I say Hard-Fi, merged with a pinch of David Byrne, Future Pleasures is intoxicating and hugely promising. Check it out below.\n\nFollow our [Spotify On Repeat playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a hand-picked selection of the current hottest tracks.",
