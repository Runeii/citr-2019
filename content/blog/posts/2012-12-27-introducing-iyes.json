Earlier this month we saw the elegant debut track from **[London Grammar](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/18774-new-london-grammar-hey-now/ \"New: London Grammar – Hey Now\")**, a wonderful pop song, that just about managed to shake its comparisons with anything **[The xx](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/18734-new-the-xx-chained-john-talabot-pional-blinded-remix/ \"New: The xx – Chained (John Talabot & Pional Blinded Remix)\")** has ever put out. This debut cut from Brighton’s **[IYES](https://soundcloud.com/weareiyes/)** may yet have the same problems. On the surface these problems are entirely justified, a boy, a girl, talking about love, loss and pain. That’s what **The xx** do. Thankfully that’s not all that **IYES** want to do. Sure they want you to think about loss, that special someone that got away, but they also want to place you in a nightclub at 3am, gormlessly staring into a strobe light, wondering how the fuck you’re going to bounce back from it all. The xx don’t do that because they never tried. IYES tried.",
