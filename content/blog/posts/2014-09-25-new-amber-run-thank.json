  "date": "2014-09-25T16:57:02",
  "body": "Huge, unadulterated stadium-pop has been filling my speakers a lot recently.\n\nFrom blog favourites **Osca** to Brooklynite’s **PROM**, the sound of massive vocal lines and emotive melody have been seriously capturing my attention. Nottingham’s **Amber Run** are no exception and new track _Thank You_ is a perfect example of their piano led pop of Coldplay proportions. Opening intimately with restrained vocals and piano chords, the track builds into something special that will surely garner them some serious attention.\n\nStream the track below and catch their new E.P _Pilot_ which was released on September 21st via RCA Victor.",
