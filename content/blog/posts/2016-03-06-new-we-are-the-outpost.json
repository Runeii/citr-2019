  "body": "Sydney eight piece **We Are The Outpost** appear to have been around for a couple of years, however it seems that in the past few months they’ve really stepped their game up.\n\nTheir ‘debut’ recording, The Motions, is shoegaze indebted indie-rock at it’s most evocative; landing somewhere between Stereophonics and Pale Saints. Brilliant.\n\n_“And it’s you I seek / to lift this downcast soul / and it’s you I seek / to renew this weary heart”. Check it out below._\n\nFollow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
