He is a musician, magician, inventor, aesthete, dreamer, doer and believer!”\n\n Not a bad introduction to an artist that has so far only released one solitary mp3. But what a tune it is. Sitting firmly between **Outcast** and **TV On The Radio** in terms of tone, his debut release is an uplifting, stomach churning, eccentric, bitter and most of all groove filled slice of break-up pop.\n\nStream the track below, and thanks to our bros at **[Get Of The Coast](http://getoffthecoast.blogspot.com)** for the heads up.\n\n [Jelly Jells- B€/\\\\UT!FU{\\_](http://soundcloud.com/jellyjells/jelly-jells) by [jellyjells](http://soundcloud.com/jellyjells)",
