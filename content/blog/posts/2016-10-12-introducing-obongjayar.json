  "body": "We’ve written before about how one of the most consistent sources of subtly emotive music available today is the nocturnal anthem, the soundtrack to late night walks through the urban sprawl.\n\n The debut single from London-based Obongjayar, _Creeping, _is a distinctive new approach that gets this right.\n\nDocumenting the city at night, each of his carefully selected words builds an image at once indirect and immediately recognisable to anyone who’s found themselves watching the 3am crowds go by. The downtempo production fits the mood of the track too, if being a little flat to stand on its own two feet.\n\nHowever it’s an assured opening from an assured new talent.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.\n\nVideo produced by Frank Lebon (NB: limited to 480p)",
