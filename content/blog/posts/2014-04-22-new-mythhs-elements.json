From the ‘in-your-face’ usage of capitals letters, to the images of a recent live show, suggesting a rather more raucous affair, I wasn’t expecting the slow burning beauty that their debut outing ends up being. From the impeccable vocals of Martha Roper, to the intricately delicate guitar lines (Harrison Clark), it’s wonderfully composed, and airily elegant. Check out Elements below, and be sure to keep an eye out for this Reading band.\n\n_you say “darling I’m the only one for you” _  \n_but I can tell by your face we both know that’s not true_",
