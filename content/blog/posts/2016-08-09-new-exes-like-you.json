  "body": "**EXES’s** Twentythousand released earlier this year became somewhat of a semi-viral hit, clocking up close to a million streams across various platforms and a whole host of online support.\n\nThe follow-up, _Like You_, comes across like a sugary sweet yet savage rebuttal of a former lover, sticking the knife in whilst also reminiscing back to simpler times, all wrapped up in some shiny pop production.
