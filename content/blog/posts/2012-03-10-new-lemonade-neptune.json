The scattered essence of their debunked scope is omnipresent, however noticeably with a wavered and lonely undercurrent. Hollow and tropical beats seem to exist in the most emotionally divergent of ways, they plod along despite the sadness, and meanwhile a torn and interceptive outpour of emotions ensues.\n\nWhatever happened before the track; the fun is most definitely over.\n\nFrom **_Diver_**; out 05/29/12 through [True Panther](http://www.truepanther.com/)",
