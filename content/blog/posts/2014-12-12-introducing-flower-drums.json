  "body": "2014 has belonged to one country – Australia.\n\nA seemingly never ending stream of quality new artists have emerged from down under, particularly amidst their blossoming electronic pop scene. **Flower Drums**, another act to add to the ever growing list, cropped up on my radar a year or so back, and released a new track last month, alongside their most recent offering, _Don’t Wait_, a collaboration with fellow Aussie, [St. South](https://soundcloud.com/stsouth). Gorgeously melodic pop gems, there’s a subtle incandescence to their music; one that we’ve seen to be a recurring theme of the music coming from Australia recently. Check out a few tracks from the quartet below.",
