  "body": "It is circumstances or chance of nature is what Lax focus’s on and attempts to capture.\n\nAt the core of Lax’s work is her choices that carefully frame natural patterns.\n\nWorking with the land itself, digging at the river beds of Bristol, to gather the silt for her beautifully rhythmic floor pieces. Delicately drying, cracking after it’s carefully and delicately applied to the floor of the gallery. Alongside her floor pieces Lax has equally beautiful and painstaking drawings that run alongside, as a means to capture the shifting of time within our environmental surroundings.\n\nI myself cannot wait to see her work in the flesh, alongside the work of Kathy Hinde, and Alice Vandeleur-Boorer, in Bristol’s Looking Glass gallery and it latest show **“As Far As The Eye Can See”.**\n\nOpening **TONIGHT** and running for the rest of the week, “As Far As The Eye Can See” looks to be a really great combinations of perspectives to create a really exciting show on contemporary ecology.\n\nCheck Out More Of Laurie’s Work **[HERE](http://www.laurielax.co.uk/)**\n\nSee More About The Looking Glass’ Nights and Show **[HERE](http://thelookingglassbristol.com/)**\n\n#gallery-1 { margin: auto; } #gallery-1 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } #gallery-1 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-1 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } /\\* see gallery\\_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php \\*/\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/New_Cut_cracked_edge-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22643-artist-profile-laurie-lax/attachment/new_cut_cracked_edge)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/new_cut_silt_drying-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22643-artist-profile-laurie-lax/attachment/new_cut_silt_drying)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/New_cut_worm-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22643-artist-profile-laurie-lax/attachment/new_cut_worm)\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/silt_cut_cracked_silt-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22643-artist-profile-laurie-lax/attachment/silt_cut_cracked_silt)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/As-far-as-the-eye-can-see-FINAL-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22643-artist-profile-laurie-lax/attachment/as-far-as-the-eye-can-see-final)",
