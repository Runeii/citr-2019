Well aside from a Pitchfork Rising article and a split release with _**CitR**_ favourites **Braids**, not much I guess.\n\nThe strikingly upbeat _Belispeak_ comes from said joint 7″ and is a fantastic mix of modern production methods and charismatic pop music. With the track featuring alongside a new cut from **Braids**, 2011 is gearing up to be another stellar year for **Megan James** and **Corin Roddick**.\n\n [Belispeak](http://soundcloud.com/purity-ring/belispeak) by [PURITY RING](http://soundcloud.com/purity-ring)",
