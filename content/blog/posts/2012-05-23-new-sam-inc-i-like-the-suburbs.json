Well, as previously mentioned, it is startlingly similar to everyone’s favourite ginger haired ‘rap’ Princess, **Kitty Pryde**, but hell, it’s kind of interesting. The lyrics are obscene and obsessional, yet somewhat appealing in their honesty. Whether or not **Sam Inc** is merely a parody of **Kitty Pryde** remains to be seen; either way, the entire ‘movement’ begs the question in my mind, is this the female response to **Odd Future**? Also, is it just me who is reminded of _Bad Babysitter_ (below)?",
