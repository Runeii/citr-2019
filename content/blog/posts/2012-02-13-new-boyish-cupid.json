  "body": "Since discovering Japan tweegaze outfit **BOYISH** [earlier in the year](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14460-new-boyish-blindfold/), I’ve developed a real soft spot for the group. Their addictive, cutesy vocals and **Pains Of Being Pure At Heart** inspired guitar riffs coupled with a heavy dose of reverb makes _Cupid_ a fantastic listen, and puts **BOYISH** at the forefront of a rapidly expanding independent Japanese music scene. Check out _Cupid_ below, and grab a free download.",
