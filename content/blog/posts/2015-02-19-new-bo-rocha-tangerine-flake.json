  "body": "You may recognise **Bo Rocha’s** vocal from another London project with a fairly considerable online following, and debut track Tangerine Flake sees her stepping out under her own guise.\n\nGranted, it’s an immensely popular sound and ‘vibe’ right now, with the out and out classic pop aesthetic of Shura, mixing with more refined moments, more akin to Liverpool’s Låpsley. It’s bold, atmospheric and a devastatingly impressive introduction. Check it out below.\n\n“I wanted to fetishize and capture—kinda like a photographer would—that moment when you commit, in your head, to gambling on something that could make or fuck absolutely everything.” ([The Fader)](http://www.thefader.com/2015/02/19/bo-rocha-tangerine-flake)",
