Whilst it may seem slightly contrived; listening to the groups sophomore offering leaves no doubt behind the origins of the fanciful label. The record in question; _**Slave Ambient**_ wears it’s **Springsteen** influences proudly on it’s Americana styled sleeves, not just through vocal delivery but also via the formulaic, structured songwriting.\n\nWay back in 2003 when the group first formed, a certain **Kurt Vile** was a founding member of **The War On Drugs**, alongside **Adam Granduciel**, who had recently arrived in Pennsylvania from California. Eight years and several line up changes later, including **Vile** deciding to pursue his now critically acclaimed solo career, the trio are now ready to release their second full length album **_Slave Ambient_.** Whilst there’s nothing untoward in openly demonstrating musical influences, it can prove slightly perturbing when a record is so weighed down by the work of those before them, causing any imaginative traits of their own to become drowned out.\n\nUnfortunately, _**Slave Ambient**_ falls foul to this particular mannerism, lacking any real energy or artistic drive. Recent single _Brothers_ is a fairly bland **Dylan/Springsteen** hybrid, that never really gets out of the starting blocks. I have no doubt that **The War On Drugs** are perfectly capable of crafting their own unique style, however **_Slave Ambient_** doesn’t portray this at all. _Your Love Is My Name_ drags on two minutes longer than necessary, and fails in creating a track that feels worthy of further listens. In trying to construct epic, Americana anthems, their own personal input becomes lost in between the idyllic guitar riffs and coarse vocals.\n\n [The War on Drugs – Baby Missiles](http://soundcloud.com/onethirtybpm/the-war-on-drugs-baby-missiles) by [One Thirty BPM](http://soundcloud.com/onethirtybpm)\n\nIt’s this vibe that overshadows much of _**Slave Ambient**_; whilst it’s not a record that is offensive on the ears, it disappoints in bringing anything exciting or uncontaminated to the table. There are touches of enthusiasm, such as the shoegaze inspired _It’s Your Destiny_; where it feels far less forced, and increasingly inherent, however these moments are few and far between. The entirely instrumental _City Reprise_ is another of the albums highlights, coming across as much more impulsive and second-nature to the group, rather than yearning to rejuvenate a time gone by.\n\nIt’s a mighty shame that **The War On Drugs** have fallen at this hurdle, as previous material was extremely promising and notably more deserving of praise than **_Slave Ambient_**. There’s nothing particularly offensive on the ears, nevertheless there are few tracks that prove memorable or invigorating enough to merit repeated listens, a fundamental element of any great album. Although **The War On Drugs** may have instigated the inception of one of the most preposterous genre name’s of the year, this album disappoints in actualizing anything truly noteworthy.",
