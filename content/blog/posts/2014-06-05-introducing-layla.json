  "body": "24-year old Londoner, [LAYLA](http://listentolayla.com/), has hit town with her 5-track  _Black Mud_ EP which she released in late April. Her sound is undoubtedly pop, featuring her _Florence Welsh-_style vocals which are complemented by perfectly timed piano and drum beats. What sets her apart is the dramatic set-up of each individual song, which could easily be imagined as the backdrop to a piece of theatre.  Personal favourite track from the EP is _Smokestacks_, brilliantly showcasing the drama of her sound.",
