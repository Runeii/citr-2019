  "date": "2012-06-12T19:27:57",
  "body": "Despite only having a few minutes of music to his name, elusive New Zealand based producer **Unmap** is rapidly marking himself out as a one to watch.\n\nWith this new reworking of fellow Kiwi’s **Black City Lights** he strips the track back to it’s bare essentials, splicing the vocals into short millisecond bursts, underpinned by a ferociously addictive warped synth section. Whilst it’s still early days for **Unmap**, with more tracks of this quality it’s only a matter of time before someone picks up on his/her talent. Check out their remix of _Collapsing Horizon_ below.",
