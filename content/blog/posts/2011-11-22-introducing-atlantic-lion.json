  "body": "There’s very little information out there about **Atlantic & Lion**, other than the fact they may or may not be based in Brighton.\n\nHowever for now these are mere periphery details, as **Atlantic & Lion**‘s ‘**I Forgot to Say**‘ is a track that can speak very much on it’s own accord. Fuzzy vocals are engrossed by jaunty guitars, built amongst a background of garage rock goodness. While the track could easily be cropped to the more recognizable four minute mark, the final two minutes provide a blistering period of guitar “shredding” that propels the record from engaging and pleasant, to an experience I’m craving to see live.\n\nYou can currently download ‘**I Forgot to Say**‘ for free on the band’s bandcamp\n\nPhoto Credit: **Nicholas Kennedy Sitton**",
