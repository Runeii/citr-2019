  "body": "Glasgow’s **PAWS** are a band rooted in the DIY aesthetic.\n\nTheir latest single _Owls Talons Clenching My Heart_ (currently premièring over at [Stereogum](http://www.stereogum.com/1677379/paws-owls-talons-clenching-my-heart-stereogum-premiere/mp3s/)) is still a testament to this, albeit with a more refined and polished edge.\n\n_Owls Talons Clenching My Heart_ is all angst ridden vocals and lethargic instrumentation until the raucous chorus kicks in, something that has come to epitomise this noisy Glaswegian trio. I’ve been bashing on a lot about how summer is just around the corner recently and I’m going to do it again. This is your new soundtrack for summertime heartbreak.\n\nTheir sophomore album _Youth Culture Forever_ is out 2nd June via **FatCat**.",
