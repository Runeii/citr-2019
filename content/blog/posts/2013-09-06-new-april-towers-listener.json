  "body": "Less than a month after they first emerged, **April Towers **have returned with a new track from their debut ‘Peaks EP’ release.\n\n‘**Listener**‘ demonstrates another exciting side to this developing two piece, with a lighter percussive base and cleaner, more crisp atmosphere than the industrial edge that pervaded through ‘**Tel Aviv**‘\n\nWhile the 80’s pop sensibilities are still very, and brilliantly, present in ‘**Listener**‘, the chorus has a pang of **Hot Chip** and the same infectious rhythmic abilities that the British five piece are known for across the music listening world.\n\nIf you’re not already, get excited and tune in to ‘**Listener**‘",
