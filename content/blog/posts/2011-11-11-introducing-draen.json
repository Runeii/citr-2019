  "body": "Nebraska drone artist [**Dræn**](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Dr%C3%A6n/198101323601448) creates some of the most surreal, vivid musical soundscapes about, combining ambient influences with minimal, dubstep inspired beats. With a handful of tracks available so far, over three releases, **Dræn** focuses on the usage of layered sounds to mastermind truly stimulating compositions. _Waterfront_ is a rather sultry, brooding piece, bubbling darkly beneath the surface for the majority of the track, before culminating in a flurry of reverb and static.\n\nFrom September’s release _**Earth, Sea, Sun**_, opening track _Earth_ is a more jovially optimistic experience, awash with angelic string sections and transcendental vocal-like synths. **Dræn** is unlikely to ever make a dint in the mainstream, however his/her music has a certain admirable aspirational quality to it, and is undoubtedly worthy of a listen, plus the artworks are simply stunning. Check out _Earth_ and _Waterfront_ below, and head over to **Dræn’s** [bandcamp](http://draen.bandcamp.com/) for more music.",
