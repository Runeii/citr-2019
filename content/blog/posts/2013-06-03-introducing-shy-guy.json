  "body": "Covering **Slowdive** on your debut EP is a surefire way of getting me to fall head over heels in love with your music.\n\n**Shy Guy**, a four piece out of Nashville, comprised of Taylor Lowrance, Brennan Walsh, Hutch Crowley and Ben Crannell are set to release a five track EP on 5 July, but have made it available for streaming ahead of time. A wonderfully assured first outing, _**Dreams**_ showcases immense songwriting talent, and a real togetherness. Be it the languid pop-gem _Off and On_, or the lovingly downtrodden romance of _Losing_, not to mention a more than worthwhile cover of **Slowdive’s** _Alison_, it’s a welcome introduction to a group overflowing with potential.\n\nCheck out the EP in full below, and keep up with the group via [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Shy-Guy/275591772570990?fref=ts).",
