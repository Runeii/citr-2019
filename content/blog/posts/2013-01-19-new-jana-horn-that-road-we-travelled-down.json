  "body": "“we could feel the earth gather ink, it was cold and it was cold and you were crying”\n\nTexas based singer **Jana Horn** has one of those rare voices that practically forces you to fall head over heels in love with her.\n\nComparisons to the likes of **Marling** and **Jaffe** are easy to draw, yet there’s a more playful atmosphere that Horn conjures up, preventing her from becoming just another female singer/songwriter. _That Road We Travelled Down_ feels like it should have a Lana Del Rey ‘Video Games’ nostalgia inducing video accompanying it, both beautiful and eerily fitting.",
