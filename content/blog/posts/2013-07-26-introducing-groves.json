  "body": "[Artwork by Annie Mackin](http://cargocollective.com/AnnieMackinArts)\n\nWith a duo of demos on their Bandcamp page, and another on their Soundcloud, London quintet **Groves**, consisting of Nick Hayes, Tim Mackin, Tom Carmichael, Dom Quaeck and Nick Baxter, toy with a sound that’s both extremely current, whilst with one foot firmly rooted in the psychedelic 70’s. Take recent track, _Encore_, that neither commits to opening out into a mid 00’s NME hungry indie spin off, or becoming a bland, basement wig out, and instead settles for the far more effective, dreamy, self-described ‘astro-hop’. A tale of ill-fated love at it’s most remorseful, it’s nostalgic, beautifully hopeless, and above all, a gorgeous listen. Check out _Encore_ below, as well as their two other demo tracks, _Roller_ and _Paperback_.",
