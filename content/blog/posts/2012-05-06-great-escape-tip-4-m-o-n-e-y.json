  "body": "There’s no band that I’m more excited about seeing at [The Great Escape](http://escapegreat.com/) than Manchester’s **M O N E Y**. At the forefront of what is an incredibly vibrant scene, the group are entirely unique in their approach to the art, chiseling both their musical and visual output to divine effect. Blending tender vocals with sombre instrumental sections, **M O N E Y** may be slightly unorthodox however in a world crawling with crass marketing campaigns and disheartening celebrity culture, they’re a much welcome breath of fresh air and potentially the future voice of disillusioned youth. **M O N E Y** play at Horatios on 11 May at 20.30, more information [here](http://escapegreat.com/artist?id=2512). Check out their stunning recent single _SO LONG (GODISDEAD)_ below.",
