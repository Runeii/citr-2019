  "body": "Fresh from last November’s release _Rosso_, ‘You Know My Name’ is the latest single from Norwegian Grammy-nominated (I know) **King Midas**.\n\nIt’s a slice of **Duran Duran**\\-esque synthpop joy, accentuated by Per Vigmostad’s voice – one that was made for this kind of music – and a nice little bit of sax towards the end. Whilst we’re at it, give ‘Snow’ a listen, too. It’s even better. https://soundcloud.com/tigerfysisiskformat/kingmidas01snow?in=tigerfysisiskformat/sets/king-midas-rosso-singles https://soundcloud.com/tigerfysisiskformat/king-midas-you-know-my-name?in=tigerfysisiskformat/sets/king-midas-rosso-singles",
