  "body": "No, before you ask, it’s not a **Cyndi Lauper** cover, in fact, **Silence Dogood’s** ironically titled _Girls Just Want To Have Fun_ couldn’t be much further from the song it borrows it’s name from.\n\nLike the gritty crunching of gravel under your feet, it’s raw, energetic and desperately catchy, just like their previous two tracks. With a chorus based around the line _“Let’s just waste some memories, I hope you make it to the ladies room”_ how could it not be fucking awesome?!\n\n<a href=\"http://silencedonegood.bandcamp.com/track/girls-just-want-to-have-fun\">Girls Just Want To Have Fun by Silence Dogood</a>",
