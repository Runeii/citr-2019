  "body": "Irish duo **Greywind** are pretty different to the usual style of music I cover on CitR, but they’re just so damn good, and definitely a throwback to my teenage years.\n\n_Car Spin_, taken from their forthcoming debut album, Afterthoughts, released in October, is another perfectly composed, energetic slice of pop-punk, that’s sure to bring comparisons to the likes of Hey Monday and Paramore. Check it out below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
