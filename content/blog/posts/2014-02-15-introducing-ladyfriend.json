  "body": "**LADYFRIEND** clearly don’t take themselves too seriously.\n\nWith the four band members ‘known’ as Slick Allen, Dru, Hot Ben and Young Maiden, hailing from New York or New Caledonian (or maybe both), there’s little I can say about them with any degree of certainty. What I can say however, is that their (presumably) debut self-titled EP, is rather glorious, for it’s unpredictability, and loveable incoherence. Racing from mock-classic rock (Lace), to R&B infused pop numbers (The Show), there’s touch of everyone from Real Estate, to Conor Oberst, to The Antlers. **LADYFRIEND** truly are impossible to pin down, and I absolutely love them for it. Check out the full release below, I recommend starting with personal favourite, The Show.",
