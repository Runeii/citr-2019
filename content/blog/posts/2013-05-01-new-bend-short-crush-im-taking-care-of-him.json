  "body": "LA is hot at the moment.\n\nWith the rise of acts like NO, The Neighbourhood and Pacific Air, we’ve also witnessed a second generation of acts following closely behind, artists like Hunter Hunted and electro-pop duo BEND. Their new double A single Short Crush / I’m Taking Care Of Him is an intoxicating mix of the previously mentioned acts, alongside touches of Vampire Weekend and Death Cab For Cutie. Verging upon sickly sweet at times, it’s slightly brash but expertly composed pop music, earmarking BEND as one of the finest new talents around.",
