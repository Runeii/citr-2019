  "body": "Now in its third year, Bristol’s Simple Things Festival has hit one hell of a stride since her recent conception.\n\nFor the 3rd year the festival will take over the cities’ many venues and clubs, filling them with pretty much every artist you’ve wanted to see in the last 3 years, (and beyond). The full line up is likely to cause you to have a little wee.\n\nNo shit, it’s bananas.\n\nSimple Things is a purist city festival, done right. Forget frustratingly low decibel limits and 11pm curfews a la Field Day, and instead get used to an immaculately curated festival that works with its environment, rather than against it. You can’t recreate a country festival in London – people should stop trying.\n\nAaaaaanyway Field Day rant – OVER.\n\nThe festival takes place this Saturday, (Oct. 12), from 12pm Saturday – 5am Sunday. Tickets are very reasonably priced at £40 and can be bought [HERE.](http://www.simplethingsfestival.co.uk/)\n\nCheck out the full line-up below!\n\nMAIN STAGE COLSTON HALL 1  \nNICOLAS JAAR  \nMODESELEKTOR (LIVE)  \nPANTHA DU PRINCE  \nTHESE NEW PURITANS  \nPORTICO QUARTET  \nTHE PASTELS  \nDARKSTAR  \nOLIVER WILDE\n\nHOWLING OWL RECORDS PRESENT: COLSTON HALL TWO\n\nNO AGE  \nHOOKWORMS  \nWET NUNS  \nEAGULLS  \nIDLES  \nVELCRO HOOKS  \nNATURALS  \nSPECTRES  \nPAWS  \nTEMPLE SONGS  \nONLY REAL  \nPORTILLO MOMENT\n\nTHE COLSTON HALL FOYER\n\nTHE FIELD  \nTHE INVISIBLE  \nHYETAL  \nVESSELS  \nSEAMS  \nFIMBER BRAVO  \nISLET  \nJOHN WIZARDS  \nFUN ADULTS  \nLADY AND THE BEEKEEPER  \nPHEDRE  \nFAIR OHS  \nANDRE BRATTEN  \nFORRESTS  \nFUN ADULTS\n\nTHE PARDON MY FRENCH TERRACE\n\nPARDON MY FRENCH  \nGRAMRCY  \nSEKA  \nSUMMITS  \nWLT\n\nRED BULL MUSIC ACADEMY PRESENTS: THE FIRESTATION\n\nJON HOPKINS  \nMARCEL DETTMANN  \nDJ JAZZY JEFF  \nMYKKI BLANCO  \nEVIAN CHRIST  \nDOPPLEREFFEKT  \nKING MIDAS SOUND  \nLETHERETTE  \nBENJAMIN DAMAGE & DOC DANEEKA  \nITAL  \nTHE KELLY TWINS  \nTYPESUN  \nDJ CHEEBA\n\nTHE FIRESTATION BAND ROOM\n\nSPALSHH  \nCHARLIE BOYER AND THE VOYEURS  \nMOKO  \nGLASS ANIMALS  \nDAM MANTLE  \nNO CEREMONY  \nTHEWYTCHES  \nFEAR OF MEN  \nFACE + HELL  \nARROWS OF LOVE  \nHALLS  \nROYAL BLOOD  \nM+A  \nEMPTY POOLS  \nJOEY FOURR\n\nTHE SHAPES COURTYARD\n\nCRAIG RICHARDS  \nAPPLEBLIM  \nAARTEKT  \nSHAPES DJS\n\nCRAZYLEGS 5TH BIRTHDAY: THE COURTROOMS\n\nMOTOR CITY DRUM ENSEMBLE  \nOUTBOXX (LIVE)  \nDJRUM  \nARTIFACT VS ZIRO  \nTOMMY RAWSON  \nJAMBO AND SHANDY\n\nSTUDIO 89 PRESENT: THE 2ND COURTROOM\n\nMAURICE FULTON  \nFUTUREBOOGIE DJS  \nNICK BENNETT  \nRIKKI HUMPHREY\n\nPLANET MU PRESNT: THE POLICE CELLS\n\nDJ RASHAD  \nITAL TEK  \nITAL  \nMISTY CONDITIONS  \nPLANET MU DJS\n\nALFRESCO DISCO PRESENTS UNDERGROUND LAZER CLUB",
