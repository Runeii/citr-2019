  "body": "WHY? frontman, Jonathan “Yoni” Wolf confirmed this week that an EP from his side project Divorcee was on the way.\n\nThe Cincinatti born wordsmith said on his twitter feed that an EP was coming [‘soon’](https://twitter.com/#%21/YoniWolf/status/169624242038636544).\n\nDivorcee is made up of WHY?’s founding member Yoni Wolf & Anna Stewart, who is credited on two WHY? tracks ‘Rubber Traits’ & ‘Pantone Cyan’. A [grainy video](http://vimeo.com/10019590) & several tweets suggest Yoni & Anna have been playing shows together since February 2010. Little else was known about the elusive duo until this week’s tweet confirming the EP.\n\nIn a [Melophobe interview](http://www.melophobe.com/articles/interview-why-summer-2010/ \"Yoni Wolf's interview with Melophobe\") from 2010 Yoni said ” I’m headed back to Oakland and going to work on some new tracks with my friend, Anna. It’s our little side project, called Divorcee. We’re doing it really low-fi, recording everything on an 8-track.” After that Yoni confirmed on twitter that four songs had been recorded, describing Divorcee’s music as [“Grimy & wonderful”](https://twitter.com/#!/YoniWolf/statuses/14503519587) and Anna Stewart as a “flawed god”.\n\nNo mp3s of Divorcee’s songs are available online yet so until then I’ll leave you with this solo cover of a Dylan classic.\n\n  \n**Yoni Wolf – ‘As I Went Out One Morning’**",
