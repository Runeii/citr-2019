  "body": "In a world of Lo-Fi home made videos and dubiously copyrighted video collages, the DIY aesthetic of most music videos created currently are a breath of fresh air, yet lack a certain emotional pull.\n\nThe work of **[Tyler T Williams](http://www.facebook.com/tylertwilliams.filmmaker)** has never had that problem, he makes work that has the emotional scope of a high budget picture, but in reality it was created by a group of kids all with the same common vision. They often work for free, and they work with a fuck load of passion. Perhaps even two fuck loads.\n\nHis latest piece is the backdrop for Boise home producer **[Youth Lagoon’s](http://www.facebook.com/youthlagoon)** new single, taken from his debut album due out on **[Fat Possum Records](http://fatpossum.com/products/the-year-of-hibernation)**. It packs a hell of a lot into the 5-minute epic; ultimately it ends in a manic and strained combination of images that will tear your heart to pieces. I won’t spoil it for you, just watch and prepare to be overwhelmed.\n\n[Youth Lagoon – Montana](http://vimeo.com/28638402) from [Tyler T Williams](http://vimeo.com/tylertwilliams) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
