Pulling from her eclectic range of influences, with the likes of **Antony & The Johnsons** and **Billie Holiday** both appearing to form inspiration for her new track, **Flo’s** vocals are as elegant as ever, singing with a maturity far beyond her modest years. Whilst the production may at times be a little iffy, there’s no telling just how far this beautiful young woman could go with the right care and investment.",
