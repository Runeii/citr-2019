  "body": "Australia has hardly been short on awesome new music in the past few months; when it comes to intelligent, atmospheric new sounds, it’s right up there at the moment.\n\n**fait**, an anonymous female musician from Perth, has just released her debut track, the shimmering _Koto_, a startling wash of shoegaze guitars riddled with dream-pop undercurrents. Entirely instrumental, the influences are clear to hear; My Bloody Valentine, Jesus & Mary Chain and Slowdive spring to mind instantaneously alongside a whole host of post-rock outfits (God Is An Astronaut in particular), with an equally as expansive production style. Check out _Koto_ below, and keep up with **fait** via [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/thisisfait).",
