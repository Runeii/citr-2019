  "title": "New: LA Priest – Party Zute / Learning to Love",
  "date": "2015-04-30T15:23:47",
  "body": "It’s quickly becoming apparent that, with his new project **LA Priest**, Sam Dust (neé Eastgate) is not fucking around.\n\nGone are the ‘quirky’ nu-rave stylings and am-dram vocal acrobatics of his former output, in its place we are seeing a mature artist shooting to carve out his own distinct style.\n\nIf you recall how the refrain vocals on first single _Oino (Engine, _his 2007 single, doesn’t count) were warped to the point of barely holding themselves together in a recognisable form, new track _Party Zute / Learning to Love_ takes this concept and applies it to every one of its many (many) instrumental layers.\n\nStarting in subdued form, the opening minute offers scant instrumentation, pairing shimmering keys alongside Eastgate’s shaking vocals. But from here things only become more muddled, with layers of whining synth and stuttering bass that stop-start, repeat and weave in and out of focus. The end effect is reminiscent of Adam Crisp’s recent work as **Clarence Clarity, **but with a clear and significant debt to last decade’s popular _new disco_ strand of revivalist electro.\n\nAs it unfurls across its 8 minute track time, practically flooding the listener with its host of touch points, _Party Zute / Learning to Love _proves itself gorgeous, expansive and genuinely exciting.\n\nIf Oino was Sam’s announcement that he had returned – post-LOTP – and matured, _Party Zute/ Learning to Love_ is his statement of intent as LA Priest.\n\nThe debut album, Inji, hits the stores 29th June.",
