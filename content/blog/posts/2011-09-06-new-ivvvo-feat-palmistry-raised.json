  "body": "This new cut from **Ivo Pacheco** ([**IVVVO**](http://www.facebook.com/pages/IVVVO/169154696472448)) and **Benjamin Keating** ([**Palmistry**](http://www.facebook.com/pages/PALMISTRY/144154198968165)) is a glorious angelic glo-fi gem. With **Keating** taking up lead vocal duties, it forms an intriguing midpoint between the work of the two producers. Bringing together the melancholic tones of **IVVVO** and the soulful vocals of **Palmistry**, _Raised_ is superbly addictive and one can only hope this is the first of many collaborations involving **Keating** and **Pacheco**.
