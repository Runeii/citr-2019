  "body": "Philadelphia electro-pop outfit [**Work Drugs**](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/8674-interview-work-drugs/) have dropped a new collaborative effort to in celebrations of the duo’s one year band anniversary. It’s been a pretty sublime 12 months for **Thomas Crystal** and **Benjamin Louisiana**, having seen their fanbase expand rapidly, largely due to the release of their debut album proper **_Aurora Lies_** a few months back. The two piece have also spent much time perfecting their live performance and crafting fitting music videos to accompany their ‘chillwave’ influenced tracks.\n\n_Dirty Dreams_ picks up on the instrumental work of Philadelphia contemporary **Dylan Sieh** aka [**Tours**](http://soundcloud.com/tours), and expands the track from there. With their wistful vocals and glistening synths, **Work Drugs** transform _Dirty Dreams_ into one of their finest efforts to date, hopefully indicating that they aren’t about to let the quality of their music slip. Listen to _Dirty Dreams_ below, and grab it as a free download if you wish.\n\n [Dirty Dreams](http://soundcloud.com/work-drugs/dirty-dreams) by [Work Drugs](http://soundcloud.com/work-drugs)",
