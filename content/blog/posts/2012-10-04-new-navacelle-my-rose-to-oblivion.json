  "body": "With **Mumford & Sons** detestable snorefest of a record, Babel, released last week to thunderous album sales, you’d be forgiven for thinking that anyone who picks up a banjo and/or an acoustic guitar, is most likely, an industry puppet hell bent on wringing the neck of emotionally honorable music.\n\nStrumming two notes on a banjo and whining about imaginary relationships using vaguely religious connotations is neither innovative nor enjoyable, and the sooner people realise that, the better. Anyway, my hatred of Mumford aside, this gem from French folk-pop troubadour **Navacelle** is well worthy of a listen.\n\nPenned as an ode to Sam, who is referenced numerous times throughout (_‘Was I, Sam, such a big jerk?’_), the confusion in translation combined with the unique accent makes it all the more adorable – _‘Near the fringe alone yelling, Not good for “elle”, leonine bell, My rose to oblivion, As flowers at your knees’_. It’s simple, yet highly effective, check out _My Rose To Oblivion_ below.\n\n<a href=\"http://navacelle.bandcamp.com/track/my-rose-to-oblivion\">My Rose To Oblivion by Navacelle</a>",
