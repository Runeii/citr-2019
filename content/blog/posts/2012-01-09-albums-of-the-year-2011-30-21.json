  "body": "#30 **Tom Vek** – _**Leisure Seizure**_\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Tom-Vek-Leisure-Seizure-500x500.jpg \"Tom Vek - Leisure Seizure\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13430-albums-of-the-year-2011-30-21/attachment/tom-vek-leisure-seizure-500x500/)\n\nIn refining his pop-nouse away from the media spotlight the past few years, **Tom Vek** re-emerged with a far tighter and tidier collection of songs. Gone are the straggly, grunge inspired live instrumentation of his debut, replaced with slick electronics and production to emphasise the strong pop- melodies on display. So there was ‘no generation-defining anthems, no radical new approach to songwriting, no active rejection of genre distinctions’ (fuck off), but to criticise this is to forget **Vek** and his album’s point. From the wonderfully catchy _A Chore_, to the closing drawl of _Too Bad_, this was an album designed to be one thing: tight fun. AH\n\n#29 **St. Vincent** – _**Strange Mercy**_\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/13-st-vincent-strange-mercy-lp-streaming-l-puo440.jpeg \"St Vincent - Strange Mercy\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13430-albums-of-the-year-2011-30-21/attachment/13-st-vincent-strange-mercy-lp-streaming-l-puo440/)\n\n**Annie Clark**, a.k.a. **St. Vincent**, described _**Strange Mercy**_ as ‘I don’t think it’s the best record I’ll ever make, but I think it’s good one’. This remarkable level of modesty is at odds with the critical acclaim to which _**Strange Mercy**_ was met with, and rightly so as **Clark** has created a record that is a beautiful tapestry of musical genius and cryptic intimacy. BB.\n\n#28 **Metronomy** – _**The English Riviera**_\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/tumblr_lgd1rjviWb1qbxyupo1_500.jpg \"Metronomy - The English Riviera\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13430-albums-of-the-year-2011-30-21/attachment/tumblr_lgd1rjviwb1qbxyupo1_500/)\n\nAs with _**Nights Out**_, their previous album, there’s a huge leap forward for **Metronomy** on display here, taking the former’s electro-pop sensibilities and refining it through a bigger, better, high(er)-budget filter. Gone are the wavering, barely in-tune synth lines and ‘bedroom-produced’ instrumentation that made **Nights Out**, instead replaced with slick, grooving bass lines; warm, saccharine electronics and actual well-sung by actual real people vocal harmonies. What’s more, the changes created one of the best indie-dancefloor filler tracks of the year, in The Bay. AH\n\n#27 **TV On The Radio** – **_Nine Types Of Light_**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/tumblr_ljbvi3GP8P1qav4gxo1_500.jpg \"TV On The Radio - Nine Types of Light\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13430-albums-of-the-year-2011-30-21/attachment/tumblr_ljbvi3gp8p1qav4gxo1_500/)\n\nAs with each of their releases, **TV on the Radio** continued to mature on **_Nine Types of Light_**, a set of fractured soul that’s by turns uplifting _(Second Song_), furious (_No Future Shock_) and heartstopping (_Will Do_), but always infectious. It’s a mellower offering than much of the band’s previous output, but the strength of songwriting on _**Nine Types of Light**_ puts paid to the outcries of any Touch & Go purists. RH.\n\n#26 **Washed Out** – **_Within and Without_**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/tumblr_lvwvdy55WA1r30eyt.jpg \"Washed Out - Within and Without\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13430-albums-of-the-year-2011-30-21/attachment/tumblr_lvwvdy55wa1r30eyt/)\n\nAfter seemingly several years in the making, **Ernest Greene** released his debut LP, _**Within And Without**_, preceded by the stunning lead single _Amor Fati_. Showcasing ‘chillwave’ at it’s utmost elegant and stimulating, **Washed Out** have also worked tirelessly to translate the album to the live circuit. Album closer _A Dedication_ also proved to be one of the highlights of the year, and perhaps hinting at a future direction for **Greene**. JD.\n\n#25 **Neon Indian** – _**Era Extrana**_\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/NeonIndian_EraExtrana.jpg \"Neon Indian - Era Extrana\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13430-albums-of-the-year-2011-30-21/attachment/neonindian_eraextrana/)\n\nSimultaneously retaining the innovation that put him on the map and pushing his sound into somewhere new, **_Era Extraña_** reaffirmed **Neon Indian’s** dominance of the chillwave scene – and quite rightly made its way into almost every end of year list of 2011. CH.\n\n#24 **Yuck** – **_Yuck_**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Yuck-Cover.jpg \"Yuck - Yuck\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13430-albums-of-the-year-2011-30-21/attachment/yuck-cover/)\n\nIt’s divided opinions in a variety of camps, _**Crack in the Road**_ included, but the eponymous debut album from fuzzed-out Londoners **Yuck** (them from **Cajun Dance Party**) has been anything but ignored. No, it’s not original or clever, and whether anyone will even remember it in another year’s time is debatable, but it is packed to bursting with slackerly sunshine, and drenched in a thick layer of sludge that sticks around longer than it’s often given credit for. RH.\n\n#23 **Beirut** – **_The Rip Tide_**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/1312485650_cover.jpg \"Beirut - The Rip Tide\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13430-albums-of-the-year-2011-30-21/attachment/1312485650_cover/)\n\n**Zach Condon’s** decision not to tie himself to the sound of any particular culture or geographical location on _**The Rip Tide**_ could have been a disaster for **Beirut**, and whilst the results aren’t too striking on first glance, the more subtle and rounded collection of songs present on the record perhaps bear up to repeated listens better than anything they’ve been preceded by. RH.\n\n#22 **Iceage** – _**New Brigade**_\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/tumblr_lhr3i1TFtr1qdtvpeo1_500.jpg \"Iceage - New Brigade\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13430-albums-of-the-year-2011-30-21/attachment/tumblr_lhr3i1tftr1qdtvpeo1_500/)\n\nRenowned for their truly raucous live performances, Danish outfit **Iceage** entered 2011 as a relative unknown and have concluded the year as a seminal act. _**New Brigade**_ is a record that establishes a punk rock sweet spot while remaining entirely genuine, and without any sense the band were masquerading in a worn genre. BB.\n\n#21 **The War On Drugs** – _**Slave Ambient**_\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/the-war-on-drugs-slave-ambient-500x500.jpg \"The War On Drugs - Slave Ambient\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13430-albums-of-the-year-2011-30-21/attachment/the-war-on-drugs-slave-ambient-500x500/)\n\n**Adam Granduciel’s** ‘bossgaze’ progenitors returned in 2011 with a record more subtle, but no less effective, than its predecessors. The clue’s in the name of course, but while _**Slave Ambient**_ can seem unremarkable at first, it unfurls beautifully on repeated spins. _Best Night_ and _Baby Missiles_ cater for the fist-pumpers, while the gorgeous, rolling _I Was There_ pisses all over anything Ryan Adams did last year. Music for those who’d rather gaze at the horizon than their feet. RH.",
