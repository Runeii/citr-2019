  "body": "Utah duo **Okkah** may well have just released one of the most exciting debuts of the year.\n\n_Budda Boy Speaks Stranger_ is self-described Symphonic Tribal Pop and to tell the truth, I’m struggling to find a more fitting genre title. Elements of Alt-J and Vampire Weekend fade in and out, particularly in the erratic, unpredictable percussion section, and deceivingly agile vocals. Check it out below.\n\n<a href=\"http://okkahmusic.bandcamp.com/track/buddha-boy-speaks-stranger\">Buddha Boy Speaks Stranger by Okkah</a>",
