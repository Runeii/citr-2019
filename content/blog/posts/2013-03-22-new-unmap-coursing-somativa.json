  "body": "Deeply elusive NZ based producer **Unmap** is one of the most mysterious figures in new music, uploading tracks online before removing them almost as quickly as they appeared.\n\nWith only three tracks and a remix available on his Soundcloud page, the latest of which were uploading in the last month – _Coursing_ and _Somativa_, **Unmap** mixes the untouchable ethereal nature of his music with purposefully clean production techniques. In truth, it’s difficult to make comparisons or label his music with genre tags; the pitch-shifted vocals lend themselves to more R&B stylings whilst the beats come across much more like a teenage bedroom producer, chiseling their own path. Check out Coursing and Somativa below.",
