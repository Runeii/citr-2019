It’s great to see the music videos that accompany the record’s singles, to be equally as engrossing. The first video from the album, for the shatteringly mournful _Hood_ drilled to the core of homosexual acceptance. It was darling, sensual and staggeringly romantic.\n\nHis new video for _Dark Parts_, another of the records’ highlights, dramatises the love between a mother and her son. Played by **Hadreas** and his own mother, the video manages to be as moving, touching and ultimately real as his last.",
