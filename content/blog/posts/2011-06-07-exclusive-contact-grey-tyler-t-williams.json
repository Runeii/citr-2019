  "body": "We first came across the fantastic work of film maker **Tyler T Williams** when we were astounded by his creations for **Pandit**‘s **Kathryn, My Love** and **Coma Cinema**‘s **Blue Suicide**.\n\nBoth incredibly absorbing and surreal visual experiences, **Tyler T Williams**‘ latest production only further reveals the very talented and unique style he has managed to craft.\n\nSituated in the late 50’s, **Contact Grey** is set to the haunting music of **Dirty Beaches** LP ‘**Horror**‘, in particular tracks ‘**Sea Drift**‘ and ‘**Desert**‘. This soundtrack inspires what **Williams** describes as ‘vivid vignettes of isolation and despair from haunting nightmares of the past’. Presented with the solitary character of a troubled man, **Jeffrey Echols**, the film displays his sustained mental break down as the narrator gives the viewer an intimate insight into **Echols** thoughts. Based around the paranoia and questioning born out of the extraterrestrial happenings in the USA during the 50’s, the film stands as a metaphor of trying to find truth in a time of ambiguity and conspiracy, only for **Echols** to dig too deep.",
