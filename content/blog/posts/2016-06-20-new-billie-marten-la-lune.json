  "date": "2016-06-20T13:30:15",
  "body": "With a growing reputation for one of the finest live shows around, and with a couple of years experience already under her belt, **Billie Marten** shows a maturity far beyond her modest seventeen years.\n\nHaving announced the release of her debut album due out in Autumn via Chess Club / RCA, and a host of festival dates over the summer, she’s also released visuals for latest track, _La Lune_. After the radio ready Milk & Honey, it’s admirable to hear her picking up again on the rawness of her early tracks. Check out the stunning La Lune below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
