  "body": "Photo: Ian West\n\nHaving featured teenage prodigy **Natasha Haws** back in [March](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/15426-introducing-natasha-haws/) of this year, she’s since taken some time off, perfecting her live show and prepping new single _Stranger_, set for release on 12 November through North East label Tiny Lights Recordings. Where Stepping Stone played upon the subtleties of Natasha’s voice, _Stranger_ is a far bolder, more atmospheric number; toying with the booming, almost tribal-esque drum beats and providing a stark contrast to the delicate vocals of the North East’s fastest rising talent. Check it out below and purchase the single [here](http://www.tinylightsrecordings.com/).",
