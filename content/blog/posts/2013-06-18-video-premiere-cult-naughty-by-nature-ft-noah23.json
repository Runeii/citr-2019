  "body": "I first heard about Arizona natives [.CULT](https://twitter.com/dotCULT) after 16-year-old producer prodigy XXYYXX shared [a track](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUPAO7C-KSM) he’d produced for one of the group’s members last year. Since then I’ve been following them with interest, their heady, hazy and lazy flow standing out in a sea of aspiring rap stars.\n\nNow following the release of their debut album, [The Three Beggars](http://dotcult.bandcamp.com/album/the-three-beggars), we’re proud to premiere the video for Naughty By Nature featuring Canadian-American hip-hopper Noah23, better known for his work with Buck 65, Jim Guthrie and Cadence Weapon.\n\nCheck out the video for Naughty By Nature and stream The Three Beggars in it’s entirety below.  \n.CULT consists of Yawning Boy, FACES, and Yung Gungho – Three artists from Phoenix, Arizona.",
