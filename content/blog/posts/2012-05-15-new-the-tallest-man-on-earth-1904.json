  "date": "2012-05-15T23:54:54",
  "body": "Having made his mark way back in 2006 with his self-titled debut album, **Kristian Matsson** aka **The Tallest Man On Earth** has slowly but surely built a loyal following for his Americana inspired folk.\n\nWith his third LP **_The Wild Hunt_** proving his most refined and critically successful work to date, anticipation will be higher than ever for his newly announced next album, _**There’s No Leaving Now**_, set to be released on 12 June. Preceded by lead single 1904 which continues in a similar vein to previous work, with the ever present tinges of **Dylan** and even **Lou Reed** amongst the sultry, unique tones. Check out 1904 below and pre-order **_There’s No Leaving Now_** [here](http://scdistribution.com/tallestmanonearth/).",
