After successfully releasing their debut single ‘**If It Wasn’t For You**‘ towards the end of last year, the band return with their sophomore effort ‘**Neon Truth**‘ and ‘**She Is The One**‘. A fantastic development in their sound, ‘**Neon Truth**‘ is an upbeat affair with jangly guitars and soaring vocals, whereas ‘**She Is The One**‘ is a much slower, and more soulful experience. A very promising release by a very promising band, and you will be able to buy the single from the **23rd May**.\n\n [NEON TRUTH](http://soundcloud.com/variouscruelties/neon-truth) by [variouscruelties](http://soundcloud.com/variouscruelties)\n\n [SHE IS THE ONE](http://soundcloud.com/variouscruelties/she-is-the-one) by [variouscruelties](http://soundcloud.com/variouscruelties)",
