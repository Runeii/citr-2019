  "body": "So there’s definitely a few lyrics from **CHLØË BLACK’s** debut track, _27 Club_, that could quite easily have been lifted from Lana Del Rey’s most recent album; whilst the production lends itself more to Lizzy Grant’s debut LP.\n\nBorn from an obsession with the notorious ’27 Club’, referring to several dozen musicians who passed away at that early age, it’s an at times harrowing comment on a rather macabre issue. Referencing Joplin, Hendrix and Cobain, there’s a certain sombre irony in the idea that this track almost feels like the sort of direction Winehouse was heading in musically, before her departure at the age of… yep, you guessed it, twenty seven.
