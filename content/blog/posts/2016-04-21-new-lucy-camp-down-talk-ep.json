  "body": "**Lucy Camp’s** Burial sampling Sixteen surfaced earlier this year, and has been firmly stuck in my playlists ever since.\n\nWith the release of her latest EP, **_Down Talk_**, she presents herself as both a potential pop-star and cultural game changer. Combining witty, cutting lyricism with a delivery that rivals pretty much any emcee around right now – it’s thoroughly addictive. Check it below.\n\nLike this?
