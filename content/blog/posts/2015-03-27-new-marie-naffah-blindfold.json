  "body": "_Marie Naffah’s_ latest release combines the talent of six visually impaired musicians (Steve Plowman, drummer, Antonio de Lillis, guitarist, Ricky James, vocalist,Rob Ellard, guitarist, Kevin Satizabal, piano and Ashley Cox, drummer) with her own in order to tell the heartfelt story of her own Grandmother slowly loosing her sight.\n\nThe project explores the wealth of issues surrounding sight loss and the importance of music to those who suffer from it through a short documentary and rerecording of her track.\n\nIn Marie’s own words: “I wanted to show to people how suffering from blindness does not automatically remove the ability to be creative and successful. The societal assumption is often a condescending one, when in fact these musicians are some of the most talented that I have ever worked with. It was important to bring this sentiment into the the public domain – so the greater population can begin to understand that by patronising and feeling awkward towards visually-impaired people it only further reinforces a feeling they might have of ‘being different’.”\n\n_Blindfold_ works alongside the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) which helps to assist over 2 million people each year whom are affected by various degrees of visual impairments. The full documentary and track can be seen here:",
