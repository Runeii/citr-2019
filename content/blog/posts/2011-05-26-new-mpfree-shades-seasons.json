There’s touches of Beat Connection in Seasons, with the majority of this electronic track comprised of an infectious hook and hazy synths. Having only dropped their first track on their soundcloud just under a month ago, Shades are already beginning to make a name for themselves, and rightly so. Their blend of lo-fi inspired indie is both engaging and original, with all four tracks available so far opening the listener up to varying experiences. They create an extremely vivid and textural atmosphere within their tracks, and with the music scene in Boise so vibrant at the moment, it’s a real testament to their talent that these guys are garnering ever increasing amounts of praise.\n\n [Seasons](http://soundcloud.com/shadesmusic/seasons) by [Shades.](http://soundcloud.com/shadesmusic)",
