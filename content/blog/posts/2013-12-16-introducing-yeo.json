  "body": "_Girl_ is the first single from the new EP Melbourne-based musician **Yeo** plans to drop in 2014, and it’s like he’s captured the pulse of a city in three and a half minutes.\n\nWith a soft fuzz and smooth, lofty synth hook, the track suddenly drops into a chasm of trembling, anxious bass. Yeo softly croons: ‘_Don’t you know my heart can be broken?_‘ It sounds less like a cathartic, forlorn plea, and more like a gentle reminder. Here, Yeo is like a mix of James Blake and Toro Y Moi, sans the desperation of the former and the occasional sonic brashness of the latter. In general, he has more than enough potential to match either in talent.",
