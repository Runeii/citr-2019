  "body": "Scantily clad women pouring milk and froot loops all over their writhing bodies? This is like my seventeenth birthday party all over again.\n\nManchester’s hottest new export, **Father Sculptor** have unveiled (via [DIY](http://www.thisisfakediy.co.uk/articles/news/premiere-father-sculptor-unveil-lowlands-video/)) these slightly unsettling visuals to accompany forthcoming single _Lowlands_, featuring a couple of rather attractive young women. Iconic and heavily sexualised, it almost works as a direct contradiction to the grandiose sound of **Father Sculptor**, with the chorus of ‘_long forgotten memories, of this city, still inside me / wanting to believe that I am free, that I can leave_‘ providing the starkest contrast to the cereal induced self-mutilation.\n\n_Lowlands_ is taken from the _**Faith & Violence**_ EP, out [15 April](http://fathersculptor.bandcamp.com/music). Keep your eyes peeled for a UK tour.",
