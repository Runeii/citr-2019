  "body": "Since emerging [last summer](http://admin.</p><p>crackintheroad.com/music/22900-new-xpriestx-samurai/), Florida duo **X Priest X** have gained more and more attention with each track released. With their debut EP out today, the group dropped a new track last week, another dreamy, perfectly produced pop number. _Sophie K_ takes the early 90’s shoegaze sound and morphs it expertly into a modern, sleek perspective, further proof of their potential ability to be real game changers.",
