As readers have turned into writers, and writers into friends, we cannot express just how thankful we are for people taking the time to read, to listen and to think; three vices that cannot be overestimated, especially in a world increasingly filled with animosity and dissatisfaction. Thank you, and may the next two years be equally as enjoyable.",
