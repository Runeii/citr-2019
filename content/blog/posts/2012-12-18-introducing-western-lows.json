  "body": "I’m a sucker for a good old bit of shoegaze inspired dream pop at the moment, and LA trio **Western Lows** fit that criteria perfectly.\n\nWith two tracks to their name so far, the group, comprised of Julien Bellin, Jack Burnside and Michael Orendy display the sort of trance-inducing sound that will have all the slickest music blogs gleefully rubbing their hands together. Of the two tracks, _Gave Away_ marks itself out as the one to break their name, with it’s vaguely industrial influenced riff and fluid vocals, whereas _Lazy_ is more of a grower; less immediate but comfortably as good, if not better than the previously mentioned piece. Check out **Western Lows** below, and keep up with them via [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/WesternLows?fref=ts).",
