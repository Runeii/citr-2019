  "body": "“_Where will you go, when you find you are alone? You don’t have a home, you should have known._\n\n” quite a forcefully miserable way for Brooklyn’s **Daytona** to announce themselves yet utterly fantastic. Their debut track _Storm So Long_ is the dictionary definition of ‘a grower’, with what on first listen appears clumsy, gradually solidifying into a stunning lo-fi anthem. As pointed out previously, it’s lyrically downbeat, but as _Storm So Long_ rumbles by, it’s nigh on impossible to not be intrigued. With no other sign of the group anywhere within the murky realms of the internet, this debut track will have to satisfy my Sunday melancholic listening cravings for now.\n\n<a href=\"http://daytonapals.bandcamp.com/track/storm-so-long\">Storm so Long by Daytona</a>",
