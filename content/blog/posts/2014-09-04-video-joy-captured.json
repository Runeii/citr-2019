As well as managing the aforementioned, he only [contributes visually](http://www.jacktoohey.com/) to several different projects, and takes some pretty awesome shots, really adding an extra dimension to the music he works with. In the case of JOY. and her fantastic debut single _Captured_, he really helps it stand out from the crowd with this vibrant, rooftop filmed video, accompanying the Lorde-esque drawl of Olivia McCarthy. It’s only a matter of time before Toohey has a bonafide hit, and judging by the strength of Captured, it could well come courtesy of JOY. Check it out below.",
