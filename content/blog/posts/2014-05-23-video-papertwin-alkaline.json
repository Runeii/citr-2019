  "body": "Brooklyn based trio **Papertwin** create beautifully dark and brooding electro-pop, with lavish helpings of dark and textured synthesizers and infectiously captivating vocal lines. Released a couple of days ago, the visual accompaniment for their track _Alkaline_ draws you into their sonic world of dark and foreboding nostalgia, depicting microscopic images juxtaposed by the enormity of the track itself. _Alkaline_ is a slow burner, it’s swirling electronics captivating and encircling you before a towering hook soars above its icy backing, releasing you from its synthetic grasp.\n\nAccording to their [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/papertwin/info), prior to forming **Papertwin, **its members were valet car parkers, land surveyors, piano tuners, landscape painters, denim tailors, movie popcorn poppers and sometimes still are. If they continue to produce tracks such as _Alkaline_, they won’t be needing to do any of that much longer.\n\nCheck out the visuals for _Alkaline_ above.",
