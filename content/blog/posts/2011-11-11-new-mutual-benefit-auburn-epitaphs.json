From the groups’ New York launch party, to the records blog-studded cast, the blogosphere really has a lot to talk about when it comes to Mutual Benefit. Their new single is due to be released on **[Kassette Klub](http://www.facebook.com/kassetteklub)**, and also features an experimental track by **Philip Seymour Hoffman**, a track **Mutual Benefit** easily outshine.\n\nThe track, **_Auburn Epitaphs_**, is a committed and charming folk gem. It floats with a graceful and sparse sensibility, sounds echoing and bouncing in the angelic yet cavernous space. In terms of genre, it sits gently between folk and benign surf-pop, yet as with all **Mutual Benefit** releases, it’s better to relax and just let the music transport you. Which is exactly what I’m planning to do.\n\nStream and D/L the tracks below.",
