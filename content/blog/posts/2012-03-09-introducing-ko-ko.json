  "date": "2012-03-09T20:59:28",
  "body": "I’m a sucker for slightly self-indulgent sad-pop, and LA’s **KO KO** has it all.\n\nCatchy choruses, semi-emotional lyrics, and a sterling songwriting ability all rear their head on their debut EP _**Float**_. There’s the **Miike Snow**\\-esque title track, which is an unashamed pop number in every sense of the word, yet the other two tracks that make up _**Float**_ show a more reserved side to **KO KO**. _Intermission_ comes across like a highly polished **Youth Lagoon**, with the lead singer weeping, “I’ll pay you back if you can drive me home, I’ll stay the night if you are there alone”. Alright, so it’s coated in an ever so sweet film, added to by the immaculate production values, yet that said, I can’t help but be enchanted by **KO KO**.\n\nCheck out the entire EP below, and grab a free download if it tickles your fancy.\n\n<a href=\"http://longlivekoko.bandcamp.com/album/float\">Float by KO KO</a>",
