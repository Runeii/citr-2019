  "body": "Emmit Fenn builds up to the release of his new Prologue EP with his latest haunting single _Woman_.\n\nCommenters on the tracks Soundcloud have been quick to liken it’s opening to Nirvana’s infamous closer to Nervermind “Something in the Way”, which whilst fair should hopefully not distract new listeners from the songs depth and beauty. Despite the intro being so dark the production choices freshen the single, mixing trap style high hats with an electro snare Woman has an R&B aesthetic that ties in well with Emmit’s breathy soulful vocals. The chorus to the song really seals the deal with the addition of a mighty disconcerting piano that looms low in the mix bordering on eerie. Have a listen to the single below.",
