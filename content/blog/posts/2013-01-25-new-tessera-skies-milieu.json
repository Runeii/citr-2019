  "body": "Having taken their first footsteps in late 2012, Newcastle trio **Tessera Skies** are all set to take 2013 by storm.\n\nWith their debut track _Soliloquy of an Astronaut_ clocking up a few thousand plays and charming the ears of Bella Union’s Simon Raymonde (who named it his Track of the Year), their newest offering, _Milieu_ is sure to propel their music to an even wider audience. With production from Pink Floyd’s Nick Mason, it’s intricate layered beauty is matched with an air of intense simplicity and understated ambience. Not too far from the **Guillemots**, their sound is a more refined, classically-influenced approach than we’ve perhaps come to expect from Northern artists. One of those tracks that immediately makes far more sense when placed alongside the lyrics, it’s an extremely promising foot-forward from one of the North East’s brightest stars, **Tessera Skies**.",
