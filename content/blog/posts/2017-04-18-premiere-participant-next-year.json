  "date": "2017-04-18T13:41:56",
  "body": "Lifted from a recently released cassette, this latest track from Dublin’s **Participant** (Stephen Tiernan) is devastatingly honest.\n\nNext Year finds Tiernan tearing himself apart with self-doubt, with an openness often associated with the likes of Keaton Henson or Elliott Smith, starting out intimately and building to a blossoming, gorgeously layered chorus of sorts. An exclusive track on the aforementioned cassette release, available [here](https://participantmusic.bandcamp.com/album/sampler), the songwriting at the core of Next Year manages to feel resoundingly current yet timelessly beautiful. Check it out below.",
