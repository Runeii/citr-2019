Here we have the first taster of second album material, in the form of free download E Numbers. Continuing in a similar twee punk fashion as their debut LP, there are touches of Fugazi meets Wire, meets Los Campesinos!. That’s a fairly awful description to be honest; anyway, check out and download E Numbers below.\n\n [Dananananaykroyd – E Numbers](http://soundcloud.com/workit/dananananaykroyd-e-numbers) by [WorkItMedia](http://soundcloud.com/workit)",
