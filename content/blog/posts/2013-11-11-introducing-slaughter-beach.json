  "body": "Whilst Blaue Blume are currently leading the way for Danish indie music, brand new trio **Slaughter Beach** are hot on their heels.\n\nConsisting of Nikolaj Westi, Hasse Mydtskov and Mads Emil Aagaard, they channel the spirit of 70’s rock band Big Star, mixed with a slightly grungier, early 90’s vibe, more commonly associated with the likes of Grandaddy and more recently, Modest Mouse. Their newest track, _Spinning Globe_, is a gorgeously composed waltz whereas debut cut _Made-Up True Love_ is a hook heavy stomper of a first outing. Check out both tracks below, and keep up with the trio on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/slaughterbeach).",
