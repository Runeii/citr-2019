  "body": "Name checking Frank Lloyd Wright in a single sounds like something The 1975 would do, and is a pretty decent indication of the level of ambition in this debut single from LA quartet **LAYNE**.\n\nSo it’s not really breaking new ground, but what it does, it does very very well indeed – mixing elements of Broods, CHVRCHES and Lorde with a brilliant outcome.
