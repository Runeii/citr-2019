  "body": "_Self Preservation_ is the brilliant UK debut single from psychedelic San Francisco rocker **AM**.\n\nAfter having his American only full length LP release named amongst the albums of the year in a poll by iTunes in 2006, it would seem nigh on impossible to live up to such high expectations, however, with a lead single like this, there is a jovial optimism about UK debut album _Future Sons & Daughters_.\n\nRaised in New Orleans, there are the obvious blues roots hidden amongst the upbeat indie rhythms, drawing comparisons to the likes of **Jim James** from **My Morning Jacket**, as well as **Brian Wilson** inspired harmonies. Recorded in the former apartment of genius songwriter Elliot Smith and coming in at little over three minutes long, _Self Preservation_ is a scintillating pop gem. Sunshine melodies and intriguing, yet at times despairing lyrics make for a fantastic UK debut single, sure to catch the attention of music fans all over the country.\n\n[Watch The Video For Self Preservation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_21nbNGSFg )\n\n[Check Out His Official Site](www.amsounds.com)",
