  "body": "The **How To Dress Well** album from last year was comfortably amongst my favourite LPs of 2014, whilst both of **TĀLĀ’s** EP releases marked her out as one of the most exciting prospects for this year, so this collaboration is pretty much a dream come true.\n\nOffering up two different versions of the same song, both have the frenetic urgency of TĀLĀ, mixed with the silky composure of HTDW. Check them out below and go buy some Adidas clothes while you’re at it or something.",
