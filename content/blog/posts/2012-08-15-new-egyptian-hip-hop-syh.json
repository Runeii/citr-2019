With superlatives being thrown at their early demo tracks, and mixed reviews of their live performances, the group disregarded the hype and quite rightfully took things at their own leisurely pace, and by the sounds of new track _SYH_ it’s certainly been worth it. Pop music in it’s most expansive, psychedelic form, _SYH_ is taken from their forthcoming debut LP **_GOOD DON’T SLEEP_** out 22 October on [R&S Records](http://randsrecords.greedbag.com/buy/good-dont-sleep/).",
