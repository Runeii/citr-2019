  "body": "After the emotional trauma of last weeks episode, **Skins** was always bound to take a more light-hearted turn.\n\nIntroducing a new character (Alex) partway through a series can be a difficult one, but it worked pretty well, aside from the line ‘everything about me is magic’. Anyway, check out all the tracks from today’s episode below, and leave any comments in the section at the bottom.\n\nAlex is introduced – **Mike Simonetti** – _The Third Of The Storms (feat. Sam Sparro)_\n\nOh dear, not Sam Sparro. Guess it was alright.  \n\nOn the radio at breakfast – **The Secret Sisters** – _The One I Love Is Gone_\n\nSlightly more folky than we’re used to from Skins, good choice though.\n\nAlex and Liv go back to his house – **Mariachi El Bronx** – _My Love_\n\nAgain, keeping up with the folk theme, but another decent choice.\n\nAlex reads his Grandpa’s diary – **Bonnie Prince Billy** – _Is It The Sea?_\n\nFantastic choice from one of the finest songwriters ever, not really used to it’s full extent.\n\nMimi dances in the pub – **Segal** – _Headroll Federal Deal_\n\nSegal…. again.\n\nAlex and Liv gamble – **Segal** – _Punishing Cake_\n\nAnd again.\n\nAlex gets intimate with Ryan – **Segal** – _Big sky_\n\nOh and again.\n\nAlex and Liv clean the house – **Nguzunguzu** – _Mirage_\n\nAlright, I’m getting bored of writing.\n\nAlex runs home – **Soft Moon** – _Tiny Spiders_\n\nAwesome choice.\n\nAlex finds his Gran at rest – **Jack Blanchard** – _Lonely Bell_\n\nCan’t find this anywhere, nice track though.\n\nAlex takes the postcard – **S. Carey** – _Broken_\n\nSlightly cheesey, but worked alright.\n\nLiv flashes – **Council Estate Supermodels** – _Keep Smiling_\n\nSo alternative and funny, right? Um. Cool track.\n\nBoat party – **Death In Vegas** – _Your Loft My Acid – Fearless Transhouse Mix_\n\nGood song originally, but kinda boring remix.\n\nAlex says goodbye to his Gran – **Death In Vegas** – _Your Loft My Acid_\n\nSlightly bizarre using the original straight after a remix.\n\nAlex and Liv in the water – **Akron/Family** – _One Spring Morning_\n\nWarning, indeh track.\n\nEnd credits – **The Rapture** – _How Deep Is Your Love?_\n\nBest track of the episode.",
