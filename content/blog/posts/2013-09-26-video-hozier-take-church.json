  "date": "2013-09-26T13:29:35",
  "body": "One of the finest songs of the year now comes with a bewitchingly fitting video, courtesy of Irish magicians **Feel Good Lost**.\n\nDealing with the ever-controversial topic of same sex love, in particular regarding the ludicrous, out-dated laws concerning homosexuality in Russia, Hozier’s Take Me To Church is quite rightly receiving praise for the content, the cinematography, and of course, the music. With the Youtube comments aflow with (mainly) intelligent debate, surrounding the issue itself, (as well as ‘WHAT EXACTLY IS IN THE BOX?!”), alongside discussing just how beautifully shot a video it is, it’s deservedly being recognised as one of the best music videos of the year.",
