Her voice has a quaintness that carries the lyrics above mediocrity, the instrumentation may be simplistic; but the sound as a whole has a certain charm despite the obvious shortcomings. It’s unashamedly empowering, filled with passion and a deserved single of the week.\n\n[Watch The Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_oMD6-6q5Y)\n\n[Check Out Her Website](http://www.marinaandthediamonds.com/)\n\n[Download ‘I am not a Robot’](http://www.billysuede.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/1-03-I-Am-Not-A-Robot-1.mp3)",
