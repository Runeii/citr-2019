  "body": "This track by New York based songstress **Lana Del Ray** has taken the internet by storm, clocking up several hundred thousand views over the past few days.\n\nDescribing her own music as Hollywood Sad Core, _Video Games_ is a haunting ode to adoration of the highest order. A delicate piano and lightly plucked harpsichord orchestrate the track, floating mysteriously over spliced footage of computer games, nostalgic films and telling shots of **Del Ray**, performing _Video Games_ against a bleak, motionless background.\n\nAt times the lyrics verge on contrived and sickeningly sweet; _‘Everything I do, I tell you all the time, heaven is a place on earth with you_‘, however the delivery pulls _Video Games_ back from the brink of becoming a self-indulgent, unoriginal track spewed out by a fame hungry balladeer, and instead adds to the unique and honest atmosphere **Del Ray** conjures up. From her stunningly elegant diva inspired looks, to her devastatingly genuine approach to music, **Lana Del Ray** is an emotionally fractured yet somehow reassuringly complete artifact, and is surely destined for phenomenal success.",
