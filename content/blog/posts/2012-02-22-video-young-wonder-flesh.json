  "body": "Taking a sample from **The Avalanches** is effectively sampling a sample, right? So say someone was to take a sample of _Flesh_, the new track by **Young Wonder**, and included it in their own work, they would be creating a sample of a sample of a sample….\n\nI N C E P T….\n\nAnyway, _Flesh_ is a huge track, yearning to be blasted through a top quality speaker system in London’s slickest clubs. Using the aforementioned sample to wondrous effect, complimented by the stunning vocals of **Young Wonder’s** Rachel Koeman, and all rounded off by yet another unique video from Cork collective **Feel Good Lost**, I don’t think I’ve heard a more danceable track so far this year.",
