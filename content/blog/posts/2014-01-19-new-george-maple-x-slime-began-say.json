  "date": "2014-01-19T03:33:59",
  "body": "This is absolute fire from London’s **George Maple**, teaming up with long time CitR favourite, **Slime** for _Began To Say_.\n\nDelicately soulful, they push boundaries both in terms of their take on the ‘traditional pop song’, and through the immaculate production. Her first new track in almost a year, and the certainly the most we’ve heard from Slime in quite a while, here’s hoping we’ll get plenty more from both parties in 2014, and maybe even a continued collaboration.",
