  "body": "Having received it’s recent premiere on **Huw Stephens**‘ BBC Radio 1 show, **Dog is Dead** have announced that ‘**Two Devils**‘ will be their next single.\n\nOut on March 5th through **Atlantic Records**, the track was produced by **David Kosten**, who has now developed close working relationship with the band. Lead vocalist **Rob Milton** describes the track as _‘Two Devils’ is a tale of guilt and insanity stemming from a twisted relationship in which a girl falls sick. It’s a little dark.‘_ This shift into a more dark and sinister region of the band’s creative output marks a development from the more twee, yet equally as brilliant, days of ‘**Young**‘ and ‘**Hands Down**‘.\n\nWith a full UK headline tour announced (dates of which you can find below), 2012 should continue to excite existing fans of **Dog is Dead**, and all of those who are yet to discover this fantastic Nottingham quintet.\n\n**Full Dates:**\n\nFebruary 7 – London Garage (supporting King Charles as part of HMV Next Big Thing)  \nFebruary 17 – The Electric Ballroom (supporting Cloud Control)  \nFebruary 18 – Norwich Arts Centre  \nFebruary 19 – Oxford Academy 2  \nFebruary 20 – Birmingham Academy 3  \nFebruary 21 – Bristol Thekla  \nFebruary 23 – Leicester Academy 2  \nFebruary 24 – Stoke Sugarmill  \nFebruary 25 – Hull Fruit  \nFebruary 26 – Leeds Cockpit  \nFebruary 27 – Newcastle Riverside  \nFebruary 29 – Aberdeen Café Drummonds  \nMarch 1 – Inverness Hootenanays  \nMarch 2 – Ullapool The Arch  \nMarch 3 – Stornoway The Woodlands Centre  \nMarch 4 – Aviemore Old Bridge Inn  \nMarch 6 – Glasgow King Tuts  \nMarch 7 – Edinburgh Electric Circus  \nMarch 8 – Belfast Auntie Annies  \nMarch 9 – Dublin Academy 2  \nMarch 10 – Lancaster Library  \nMarch 11 – Sheffield Plug  \nMarch 13 – Manchester Deaf Institute  \nMarch 14 – Brighton Komedia  \nMarch 15 – London Borderline  \nMarch 16 – Southampton Joiners  \nMarch 17 – Cardiff Arts Institute",
