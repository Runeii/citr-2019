Not much, I tell you that.\n\nSoCal based rockers [Candy Paint](http://www.starveyourhead.com/) explode onto the scene with their rampant debut track, _Vomit Lips_; a three minute barrage of sleaze, grit and scuzzy guitars, all built upon purposefully outdated sounding recording techniques. Soliloquising about drug-fueled binges, fucked up teenage romances and twisted regrets, _Vomit Lips_ makes me feel like I’m at an illegal downtown garage-party as opposed to sitting at my desk, drinking green tea. Rock and roll, eh?\n\n_ Demon at the swap meet__                                                                                                  Yeah, sellin’ deficits for dirt cheap__                                                                                                                   Don’t give a fuck about your policy_",
