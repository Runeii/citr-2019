  "body": "This bizarre new video from Miami based beat maker **Teams** for new track _MVP_ is a visual delight, splicing together various scenes from 80’s music videos and iconic films.\n\nMuch like the music itself, the **Ben Tabas** directed video is dominated by the incomprehensible unknown, flashing sporadically between vibrant video game cuts to what appears to be segments of homo-erotic fitness tapes. There are some fantastic shots in the short clip, including the one featured above, and it’ll take more than a few watches of _MVP_ to truly appreciate the density and complexity of this music video. _MVP_ is a free download from **Teams’** [bandcamp](http://teeeams.bandcamp.com/track/mvp), and the video can be watched below.\n\n[Teams – MVP](http://vimeo.com/27391158) from [Ben Tabas](http://vimeo.com/bentab) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
