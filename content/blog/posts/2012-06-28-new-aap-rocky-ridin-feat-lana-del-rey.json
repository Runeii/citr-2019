  "title": "New: A$AP Rocky – Ridin' (Feat. Lana Del Rey)",
  "date": "2012-06-28T15:01:30",
  "body": "So having appeared together in **Lana’s** recent [grossly exuberant video](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/17116-video-lana-del-rey-national-anthem/) for _National Anthem_, **A$AP Rocky** has called in the pouty lipped songstress for an appearance on _Ridin’_, taken from his upcoming album _LongLiveA$AP_. As to be expected from A$AP, the beat is slick and deliciously produced, whilst Lana’s vocal sections are as cliched/pronounced as ever. “_Pick me up after school/you can be my babe/maybe we can go somewhere go a little crazy_” – hardly inspired lyrically, but hey, it’s pop music, right?",
