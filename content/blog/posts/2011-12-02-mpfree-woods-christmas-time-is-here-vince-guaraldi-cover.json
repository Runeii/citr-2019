  "body": "Everyones favourite psych-folk weirdos **Woods** have decided to cover one of the truly best Christmas songs of all time (in my humble opinion).\n\nThe original by the **Vince Guaraldi Trio** was part of the album _A Charlie Brown Christmas_ – everybody must remember Charlie Brown and Snoopy, right?\n\nAnyway, **Woods** have done a perfectly fitting cover in time for the holiday season. And never have I heard such a grateful Christmas-themed cover in respect for the original(s) since…**Weezer**‘s _Christmas with Weezer_? Admittedly, **Mayer Hawthorne** did cover this same track last Christmas (using the original instrumental), but this new one really does take the (Christmas) biscuit…\n\nOkay I’ll stop. It’s the end of the article anyway.\n\n_Listen to and download Woods’ cover of Christmas Time Is Here below. If you don’t like it, you’re a real Scrooge._",
