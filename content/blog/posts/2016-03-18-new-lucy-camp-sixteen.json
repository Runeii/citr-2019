  "body": "Every now and then a track comes along that I have to play numerous times, before being able to form any sort of opinion on it.\n\n**Lucy Camp’s** newest track, _Sixteen_, falls very much into this category. It’s part Kitty Pryde, part Azealia Banks; almost the epitome of internet age hip-hop. It’s garish, uncompromising – not to mention perhaps knowingly arrogant to rap over Burial’s Archangel – yet there’s something I absolutely love about it. Check it out below; I’m going back for my sixteenth listen.\n\n<a href=\"http://lucycamp.bandcamp.com/track/sixteen\">Sixteen by Lucy Camp</a>",
