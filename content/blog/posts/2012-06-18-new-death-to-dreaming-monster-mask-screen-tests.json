  "body": "Having stumbled upon **Death to Dreaming’s** stunning debut track [_Paris 1_](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14669-new-death-to-dreaming-paris-1/) some four months back, I increasingly began to feel that one outing might sadly have been the first and last we’d hear of them. However in mid April **Alex Mattinson** (formerly of **These Single Spies** and now lead guitarist with **Emmy The Great**) got in touch to thank CitR for posting about **Death to Dreaming**, his new musical project, and to inform us of us intention to put out more new tracks in June. True to his word, here they are, in the form of the lo-fi pop inspired _Screen Tests_ and _Monster Mask_.\n\n  \n  \n\nDrawing from the likes of **Boards of Canada** and **The Magnetic Fields**, there’s a gloriously unique songwriting quality to both songs, that simultaneously feel emotionally unstable yet confidently self-assured. Check out _Screen Tests_ and _Monster Mask_ below, as well as the previously available _Paris 1_ and keep up with Alex via [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/deathtodreaming) and [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/deathtodreaming).",
