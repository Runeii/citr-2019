  "title": "Premiere: Francis Novotny – Hit N Run",
  "date": "2017-03-16T11:13:43",
  "body": "With his intriguingly experimental debut track appearing online a few weeks back, Gothenburg’s (via Paris) **Francis Novotny** has followed up Run Away with a striking second song in the form of the daringly colourful _Hit N Run_.\n\nRaised on the diverse record collections of five older siblings, his own creative offerings are as imaginative and vibrant as his mysteriously elusive background would suggest.\n\nSeamlessly merging elements of electronic R&B with audacious synth hooks, alongside showcasing his smooth, distinctive vocal, Hit N Run reveals a more playful side to Novotny. Influence wise there are head nods to everyone from Gorillaz, to Cashmere Cat amongst the adventurous production, whilst elements of SOHN and Jai Paul seep through the songwriting, yet there’s a confidence that allows Hit N Run to feel in a class of its own. Check it out below, alongside Run Away.",
