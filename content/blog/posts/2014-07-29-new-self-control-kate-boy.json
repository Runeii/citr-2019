That electro-pop trio of Swedes, Kate Boy, have finally released a new track that makes the wait more than worth it.\n\nAfter three infectious (and successful) singles last summer Self Control comes at the perfect time to reignite the hazy lazy summer air.  The rippling anthem of electronic love sounds like a missed lead single off fellow Scandinavians, The Knife’s, iconic album Deep Cuts. Its time to lose control in self control and live.",
