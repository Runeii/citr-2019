  "body": "The last time **CITR** wrote about **[Det Lilla Extra](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/5528-introducing-det-lilla-extra/ \"Introducing: Det Lilla Extra\")** they were wearing the ‘Witch House’ sound firmly their sleeve. The music wasn’t bad, just in hindsight there was very little to distinguish them from a lot of music out there. The follow up to the two tunes released by the _Umeå_ based group back in March, does its best to fuck with the sound they helped to create. What we have here is what can only be described as ‘Reggae House’; you heard it here first. Syncopated tropical synths playfully reverberate through the track, with childlike giggles drawing in a claustrophobic and delirious blanket over what could have been a fairy summer influenced sound. Tonally, it’s actually a pretty stimulating mix.\n\nStream and download the track below.\n\n [En enda röst](http://soundcloud.com/detlillaextra/en-enda-r-st) by [detlillaextra](http://soundcloud.com/detlillaextra)",
