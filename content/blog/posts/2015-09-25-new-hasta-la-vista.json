  "body": "Ahead of the release of his forthcoming Botanique EP on the 2nd October, Norwegian producer Hasta has dropped his most exciting track to date, La Vista.\n\nOriginally premiered over on THUMP, La Vista is a swooning, smooth piece of  music, full of undulations and dynamics, guiding the listener through an elaborate electronic soundscape. It’s not surprising then that Hasta has started to develop a strong following, strengthened by swathes of critical acclaim for his own work and his work with his contemporaries, including the likes of Goldlink and Glacci.\n\nYou can check out more of Hasta’s work over on his [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/thisishasta), and you’ll realise he is definitely not an artist to be slept on.\n\nPhoto Credit – Renate Madsen",
