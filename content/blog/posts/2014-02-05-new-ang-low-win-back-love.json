  "date": "2014-02-05T13:38:47",
  "body": "One of the blog breakthrough artists of last year, **ANG LOW** hits the ground running in 2014 with the rather fantastic _Win Back Your Love_.\n\nWith his debut EP set for release through Luv Luv Luv Records at the end of March, it’ll be interesting to watch how he makes the transition from blogstar to ‘mainstream’ popstar, and if there’s any track that can do it, it’s this. Remorse-fuelled R&B; it’s bold and delightfully intoxicating.",
