  "body": "Elusive Greek duo **Keep Shelly In Athens** teaming up with our long-time lovers Cascine is a match made in heaven.\n\nWith _Madmen Love_ their first new material in over a year (aside from remixes), it’s a welcome return, and an ambitious one at that, with the vocals of Sarah P proving purposefully strained whilst the production of RΠЯ owes more to early 70’s rock than the chillwave movement that they were initially heralded under. It’s dark, slightly foreboding and more than anything, it’s a real wake-up call to those artists that are perfectly content with simply allowing their sound to stagnate. Keep innovating.",
