  "body": "‘Love is all you need’, apparently.\n\nI’m starting to think differently after glancing my peepers on the work for **Lucy Bishop**. Her paintings speak a metaphorical language about the darker side of romantic love; observing love as a sickness. She literally paints a picture of how the tangles of a relationship may pull you in all emotional directions; spitting out the backside of the person you was once before, well maybe, or maybe not, who knows.\n\nTechnically stunning and filled with wit and charm; every image tells an honest narrative, one you wouldn’t mind framing and popping on your wall either. The tiny heads and pronounced genitals are something that would get a LOL on any dull day.\n\nAnd oh what mastery to be able to speak the s\\*\\*t stuff so beautifully! A sigh of relief, that relationships are not all takeaways and Sundays, and that it’s JUST FINE that we can all turn into irrational, needy and sobbing drip bags when you are taken by the wings of love.\n\nTo sample more of Lucys work, click [here](http://lucybishop.com/) for her website. #gallery-1 { margin: auto; } #gallery-1 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } #gallery-1 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-1 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } /\\* see gallery\\_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php \\*/\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bowandarrow2-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/24582-artist-profile-lucy-bishop/attachment/bowandarrow2)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/circlelove2-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/24582-artist-profile-lucy-bishop/attachment/circlelove2)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tangled22-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/24582-artist-profile-lucy-bishop/attachment/tangled22)",
