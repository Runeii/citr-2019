  "date": "2013-08-07T22:10:43",
  "body": "Well we’ve already had one cover this week of the greatest song ever written, so hell, why not another one? **London Grammar** dropped by Maida Vale to record a session for Huw Stephens, and produced this rather gorgeous version of **Chris Isaak’s** _Wicked Game_.\n\nThe vocals are as perfectly smooth as ever, and the silky guitar work is in keeping with their own original material, and whilst it’s not quite on the same level as **WU LYF’s** strained version, it’s certainly up there. Check it out below.",
