  "body": "Ah summer; how I love your ability to starkly change the landscape of contemporary music in a heartbeat.\n\nEvery year, without fail, the longer days, hotter weather and carefree vibes bring with them a musical output quite distinct to the season.\n\nThe first cut from **Halfway Kid** rides that wave quite majestically.\n\nHis first cut, _Saying Nothing_ is a hazy and mellow love song. It’s quite charmingly casual in its delivery, a declaration of love in its purest form, shy, timid and unsure of the best way to ask. It’s also distinctly of the moment, stylistically playing on elements of **Mo Kolours**, **Vondelpark** and **Jungle**, to name but a few.\n\nBut regardless of the wave he’s riding, both sonically and seasonal; London native **Saeed Gadir** has a attitude to song writing that’s truer than most.\n\n**Halfway Kid** has a 5 track EP entitled _Patterns_ dropping later this week followed by the announcement of his first show in the not too distant future.",
