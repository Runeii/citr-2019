Last year’s **Nothankyou** collaboration with Dirty Projectors’ Olga produced a effortlessly catchy double A side, but even that was years in the making.\n\n_Luck_, we’re promised, sees Vek in more experimental form than ever. On the strength of preview track /single **Sherman (Animals in the Jungle)** alone, we’re not reallt able to judge whether that’s true. What we do get is an energy that was missing from the, well, leisurely _Leisure Seizure_. A driving rhythm section propels the action forward, save a brief pause, under synth loops and a jingling guitar riff.\n\nThe end result is not dissimilar to _A Chore,_ but shifting the focus of the track away from his ‘unique’ approach to vocals (I like them, your mileage may differ) back to the repertoire of instruments he is staggeringly proficient with might broaden his appeal this time round.\n\nHis lyrics still makes no sense, mind.",
