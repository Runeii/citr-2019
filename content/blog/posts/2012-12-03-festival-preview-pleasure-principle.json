  "body": "Anyone that attended [Bloc 2012](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/17145-preview-bloc-2012/ \"Preview: BLOC 2012\") earlier this year saw the death of 2 important things; the death of the UK’s flagship electronic music festival and the demise of the ‘location based music festival’. Once the anger had subsided, all we were left with was a grand sense of loss. This empty space was always going to be filled, but the questions of ‘how’ and ‘when’ were pressing ones.\n\nNext year will mark the 10th anniversary of the Glasgow-based [Numbers](http://nmbrs.net/) label, and the label will be teaming up with Dedbeat Festival to launch [Pleasure Principle](http://pleasureprinciple.net/), a project that by the looks of things will pick up exactly where **Bloc** left off, minus the overselling of tickets and poorly managed site, (hopefully). Set to take place in Cornwall’s Trevelgue Holiday Park, it’s a reinvention of the **Bloc** formula with a new lease of life the idea most certainly needed. Plus the line-up looks fucking UNBELIEVABLE.
