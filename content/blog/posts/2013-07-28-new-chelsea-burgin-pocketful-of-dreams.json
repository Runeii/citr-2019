  "date": "2013-07-28T20:16:14",
  "body": "It’s been too long since we last checked in with **Chelsea Burgin**, and it would appear that things are very much on the up.\n\nIn a message posted on her Soundcloud, she states “I found this song I wrote a while back(and played guitar poorly to) and for some reason it seems fitting to share now”, however it doesn’t feel like just a throwaway track; there’s a genuine sincerity and understated beauty to _Pocketful Of Dreams_. As with previous songs, much of the breathtaking elegance comes from **Burgin’s** divine vocals, mixed with just the right amount of silky reverb. To quote again from her Soundcloud… _this is just the beginning…_",
