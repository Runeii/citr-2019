  "body": "How do you even begin attempting to cover the greatest song ever written? So it’s safe to say that Luxembourg’s **We Are Intemporal** don’t better the original, but hey, that’s impossible, but they certainly give it a good stab.\n\nTheir cover of **Chris Isaak’s** _Wicked Game_ brings the 1989 classic into a far more modern light, sort of how I’d imagine it sounding if James Blake was to give it a go. Maintaining the perfect pop vibes that’s given it such longevity, We Are Intemporal stamp their own, rather minimal-inspired authority upon it.",
