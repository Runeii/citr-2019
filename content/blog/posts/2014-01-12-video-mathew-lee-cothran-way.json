  "body": "Having teamed up in the past for several **Coma Cinema** videos, Boise filmmaker Tyler T Williams has lent visuals to **Mat Cothran’s** _No Way Out_, lifted from a four track EP released outside of the Coma Cinema / Elvis Depressedly monikers.\n\nYet again proving his worth as one of the most creative and thought provoking directors around, Williams develops such strong narrative elements in his work, that fit perfectly in with the wistfully bleak lyrics of Cothran. Check out the video below, and stream Cothran’s full EP over at [Bandcamp](mathewleecothran.bandcamp.com).\n\n[Mathew Lee Cothran – No Way Out](http://vimeo.com/83646667) from [Tyler T.
