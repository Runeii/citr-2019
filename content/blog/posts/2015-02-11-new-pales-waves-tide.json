  "body": "**Pales Waves** first cropped up on my radar about a year ago, albeit under a different name (Creek, if I remember correctly).\n\nSince the name change, it appears they’ve cleaned things up slightly, both in image and sound, with their latest track, _The Tide_, being a huge step up from the potential heavy debut, Lust. So there’s hints of the likes of The 1975, Peace and Swim Deep in their sound, but more than enough of a hook for it to really feel like it carves out its own niche. Check out The Tide below, alongside their demo of Lust.",
