  "body": "A couple of months back I wrote about the bubbling electronic scene in India right now, and since then have made a conscious decision to explore more of the musical offerings emerging from Asia.\n\nMumbai / New Delhi / Boston’s **Alisha Batth** is a rather special talent, as showcased on the couple of original tracks she has online, alongside two Patti Smith covers. Dark, gritty and uncompromising at times, the six minute epic that is _Familiar_ is one of the most hard-hitting, unique songs I’ve heard in quite a while, switching effortlessly between her Angel Olsen-esque drawl and a heart stopping shriek. Lines such as “I’m older and skinnier / the lines look familiar / my hands might be shaky / but they look very similar” strike right to the core, as emotionally poignant as any you’ll hear this year, no doubt. Check out _Familiar_ and _Filth_ below.\n\n<a href=\"http://alishabatth.bandcamp.com/track/familiar\">Familiar by Alisha Batth</a>",
