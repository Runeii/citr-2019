  "body": "With a list of 80’s influences as long as your arm, it’s no surprise that **Kulaks** new track _We Can’t Be Friends_ recalls the likes of **The Cure** and **The Smiths**.\n\nIf it wasn’t for it’s slightly dirty edge, it could quite easily float on by without so much as a shudder (much like **The Vaccines**, **Two Door Cinema Club** etc. have), yet it’s an unashamed four and a half minutes of ever-so self-indulgent anthemic pop. Brash, assured and overflowing with youthful confidence, it’s **Kulaks** best track to date.",
