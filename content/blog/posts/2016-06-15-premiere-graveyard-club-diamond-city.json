  "body": "Photo: Chelsea Rice\n\nMinneapolis quartet **Graveyard Club** write the sort of upbeat yet slightly ominous synth-pop that New Order pioneered back in the 80’s; anthemic, emotive and somehow exceedingly danceable.\n\nTheir latest track, _Diamond City_, lifted from **_Cellar Door_**, their sophomore record out later in the year, is insanely addictive and absolutely perfect for those summer playlists. Full of energy and character, it suggests a very exciting LP may well be on the way. Check it out below.\n\nLike this?
