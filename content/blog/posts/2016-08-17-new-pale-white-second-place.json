  "body": "**The Pale White** are (arguably) the UK’s best new band right now.\n\nI’ve caught them live a couple of times in the past few months, and their frenetic energy is infectious, and just destined for stages far larger than the ones they’re gracing right now. Part of what’s so brilliant about the trio is that they don’t pull punches with their ambition – they want to be playing to packed out festival tents and have thousands singing every word back to them – and with more tracks like latest offering _Second Place_, there’s absolutely no reason why that can’t become a reality very soon. Check it out below, and get details of their next headline show [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/121448894960825/).",
