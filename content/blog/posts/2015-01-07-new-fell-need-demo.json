Lack of clues aside, his first offering is a gorgeously composed number, a testament to true love, showcasing both an enviable grasp on melody and touching lyricism. Part Tobias Jesso Jr. part Nick Drake, it’s a stunning first step.\n\n<a href=\"http://fellsongs.bandcamp.com/track/you-are-all-i-need-demo\">You Are All I Need (Demo) by FELL</a>",
