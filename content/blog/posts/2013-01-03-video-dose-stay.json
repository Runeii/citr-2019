  "body": "Ohio producer **Dose** goes all Lana Del Rey on us in this music video for recent track _Stay_.\n\nSpliced together VHS reels amidst an overarching sense of melancholic nostalgia, the visuals are fitting to the laid-back ‘glo-fi’ vibe of the music itself. Whilst checking this track out, I realised just how criminally underrated **Dose** aka **Jeremy Rike** is; with several top-quality releases to his name, it’s surely only his admirable lack of self-promotion that prevents him from hitting the blog-heights. Check out _Stay_ below and keep up with **Dose** over on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dose/178912355473075).",
