With their debut LP of the same title set to be released later in the year via [Hardly Art](http://www.hardlyart.com/), and a rapidly expanding following eagerly anticipating it’s arrival; it’s set to be a hectic year for **Gem Club**. The piano driven “Breakers” is hauntingly heartwrenching, nervously shuffling in somewhere between **Youth Lagoon** and **Perfume Genius**, and expertly utilizing the soft yet piercing vocals of Christopher Barnes. Being the first new material since last year’s EP _Acid and Everything_, this melancholic track has been met with stunning reviews, cementing the two-piece as a real talent to watch out for. Check it out below, and head over to their bandcamp to download “Breakers” for free.",
