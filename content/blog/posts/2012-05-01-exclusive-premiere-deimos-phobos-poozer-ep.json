  "body": "In an age where music can be chewed and then spat out so easily, it’s increasingly hard for musicians to keep our attention, especially as we’re now also meeting artists so early in their careers.\n\nNothing is pristine or overtly planned anymore, and largely, we’re all the better for it.\n\n[**deimos phobos**’](https://www.facebook.com/thedeimosphobos) ,(aka **Elliot Etzkorn**), and his debut EP, **_Poozer_**, is one of those releases that demands attention but also leaves one intrigued as to where the sound could go. It’s not fully developed, but frankly it doesn’t have to be. The classically trained pianist from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, has my attention. The melodies are warm, the beats quietly escalating with the over arching ambience creating something understatedly rapturous.\n\nPoozer is out on [Housewarming Records](http://housewarmingrecords.bandcamp.com/) today.
