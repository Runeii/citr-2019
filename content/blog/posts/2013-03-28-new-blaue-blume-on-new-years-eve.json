  "body": "Photo: Daniel Schriver\n\nWell this is just a little bit special.\n\nCopenhagen’s **Blaue Blume** would probably be the first to admit that their band photo hardly lends itself to expecting the level of beauty possessed by their debut track, _On New Years Eve_.

Check it out below, and keep up with **Blaue Blume** via their [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/blaueblumemusic) page.",
