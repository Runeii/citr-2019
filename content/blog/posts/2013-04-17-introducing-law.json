  "body": "Credit to Shiny Shiny New and Song, by Toad for bringing this to my attention; it’s safely one the best new tracks I’ve heard in 2013.\n\nLAW, otherwise known as Lauren Holt, hails from Edinburgh and appears to have connections with fellow Scottish act, and Anticon signings, Young Fathers. Deep, dark, and brooding, LAW’s debut track ‘Hustle’ fuses primal, pervading bass lines with a driving percussion. The video for ‘Hustle’ is as menacing as it is brilliant, projecting an insight into the troubling, warped subject matter of a track that is very cleverly presented in a shroud of pop sensibilities.",
