Another track that features predominantly in their energetic live sets; pairing cutting wit alongside intelligent, highly observant lyricism. ‘The first term, fifth page in my book, explains how, I found it hard to get it up’ jokes lead singer Matt Robson, in a tone entirely reflective of Athletes in Paris smooth yet quirky manner. With Just Decline available to download for free, and another single expected later in the summer, Athletes In Paris are rapidly garnering an enthusiastic following in their hometown through their two tracks made available so far and their fantastic live shows. Download or stream Just Decline below.\n\n<a href=\"http://athletesinparis.bandcamp.com/track/just-decline\">Just Decline by Athletes in Paris</a>",
