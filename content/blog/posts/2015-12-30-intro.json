  "body": "In the lull between our festive decadence and the heady heights of New Year we’ve come across a soulful masterpiece, ‘People Say’.\n\nThere is very little information surrounding the track at this present time, however we know it’s the work of an artist called ‘Seramic’.\n\nBuilt on a bedrock warbling guitar lines and rising choral vocals, the song reaches out to the listener with a veil of intimacy, while working it’s way through periods of fragility and releases of resilience.\n\nWe look forward to hearing more from Seramic in 2016.",
