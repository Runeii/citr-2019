  "body": "The most overhyped band of 2012 **The XX** announced their return last month with the beautifully understated new track [_Angels_](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/17404-new-the-xx-angels/), and now the recently [Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com/news/47418-hear-a-new-song-from-the-xx-chained/) premiered _Chained_ picks up where the aforementioned song left off. Ever so slightly more upbeat, and mixing the male / female vocals, _Chained_ isn’t too far from the sound of their self-titled debut LP, and again relies upon the indescribably perfect production, that’s utterly flawless throughout. Whilst the number of ‘non-articles’ that **The XX** provoke (e.g. ‘Here’s six seconds of **The XX** blowing their noses live’), can be disarmingly frustrating, there’s no doubting that _**Coexist**_ is one of the most hotly anticipated releases of 2012.",
