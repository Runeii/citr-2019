  "body": "I feel like I’ve been waiting all my life for this.\n\n**Celeste Cruz** aka THE Celeste (from Daphne &… obviously), ‘creators’ of 2000’s single of the year U.G.L.Y., as well as the criminally underrated Ooh Stick You, has gone somewhat off the radar in the past ten years. Having returned to college following the short lived success of the bubblegum pop duo, Celeste has emerged with her first recorded material since her initial spotlight attention. Just A Phase, a collaboration with Detroit singer/producer Kent Odessa is a blog-hot R&B/pop number, expertly written and produced. Featuring vocals from both Odessa and Cruz, it’s one of the finest pop tracks of the year, and it feels great to say that. I have to admit, I hadn’t expected to hear from Daphne & Celeste again, but this is a rather wonderful surprise.\n\n_what was he like as a lover, did he make you tear the sheets to shreds?_",
