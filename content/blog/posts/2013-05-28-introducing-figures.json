  "body": "There seems to be an awful lot of awesome new music coming out of California at the moment.\n\nWith the likes of **The Neighbourhood** and **NO** leading the charge, it appears that there’s a real ambition to the Cali music scene, and Oak Park quintet **Figures** are no different. With their explosive yet measured debut EP, titled **_Monsters_**, they prove their worth as songwriters, capable of penning both epic, stadium ready anthems (_Ghosts_) and more tender, heartfelt numbers (_How To Grow Old_), sandwiched between lead single _Stay_. From Jillian Medford’s versatile vocals to the hook heavy guitar riffs, Figures are a band with a very bright future ahead of them. Check out their debut EP below.",
