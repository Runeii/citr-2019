  "date": "2016-06-26T19:56:08",
  "body": "The transition of LA’s Brandyn Burnette to blog-pop sensation has been seemingly overnight, and fascinating to witness.\n\nListings the likes of John Mayer and Coldplay amongst his inspirations and having a crystal clear visual theme running through his releases, it’s clear that his ambitions are not to be downplayed. His recently released EP, **_State I’m In_**, is his most varied and appealing release to date – merging emotional ballads like Underneath with almost Timberlake-esque pop tracks like Set In Stone and State I’m In. Check out the full EP below, alongside a video for previous EP track, Lost.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
