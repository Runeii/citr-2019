  "body": "There’s no quesiton that LA duo **Kyivan Rus (K.**\n\n**C. Maloney & Luke Waites)** are not quite the finished article just yet, but their newest track, _War Machine_, certainly shows development and an abundance of potential. It does has hints of, as they describe, a ‘post-apocalyptic’ atmosphere, hidden away amongst the drone influenced synths. In truth, much of the beauty lies amidst the combination of the vocal and string sections, that echo the likes of Manchester’s **MONEY**. Whilst the production falls slightly flat at times, particularly on the vocal, there’s more than enough here to suggest that **Kyivan Rus** have an extremely bright future ahead of them.",
