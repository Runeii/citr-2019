  "body": "Toronto’s **Prom** possess a certain melancholy that few bands manage to conjure up, creating music in such apparent emotional solitude.\n\nTheir new EP, **_Spring Training_** is four tracks of The National and Joy Division inspired loneliness, from the more upbeat chorus led _Katie_, to the downcast _Nineteen Again_, centred around the haunting refrain, “_pretend you’re nineteen again / and i’ll let you down_“. So **Prom** are still very much learning their trade, however on Spring Training there’s an underlying true passion behind what they do, and whilst it may be a while before they’re noticed by a larger audience, you can almost guarantee it will happen at some point in the future.",
