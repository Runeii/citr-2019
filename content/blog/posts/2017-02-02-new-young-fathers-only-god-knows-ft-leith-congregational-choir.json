  "body": "Scottish trio Young Fathers return with their latest single, taken from the soundtrack of T2: Trainspotting, _Only God Knows ft._\n\n_Leith Congregational Choir. _\n\nWith a hard hitting, pulsing rhythm that Danny Boyle went so far as to describe the track as the “heartbeat for the film”, it continues the sound of their 2015 album _White Men Are Black Men Too**. **_The song’s fast tempo echoes that album’s opener _Still Running,_ with lo-fi production breaking up the trio’s rapid-fire split verses and repeated shouts of “only God knows” with an industrial sounding drum sample and soft falsetto backing vocals.\n\nIt’s the addition of the Leith Congregational Choir that gives the song such an uplifting quality and takes the trio to new gospel heights, their singing perched atop a synth organ that both starts and ends the song.\n\nGod Only Knows definitely has us looking forward to whatever the Mercury Prize winners have next in store.",
