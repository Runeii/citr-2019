It sat reluctantly on my ‘must listen’ list, tempting but never completely convincing me to give it a full listen. Looking back I wish I had, because if this re-mastering of stand out track (apparently), ‘**_BB Bleu_**’ is anything to go by, then the album is sure to be quite a treat.\n\nStream the re-mastered cut below, stream the whole LP [here](http://ppponeyost.bandcamp.com/) and follow Kid A on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/KIDAISKOOL) to hear more of her impending release **_[BLCKRSECHLL](https://twitter.com/#!/ilovekida)_.**",
