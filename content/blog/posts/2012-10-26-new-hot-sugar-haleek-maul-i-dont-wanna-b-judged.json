  "date": "2012-10-26T20:13:01",
  "body": "**[Haleek Maul](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/17020-stream-haleek-maul-oxyconteen/ \"Stream: Haleek Maul – Oxyconteen\")** splits me; on the one hand when listening to his flow, I feel the need to hold out my hand out, professing his anger and discontent as being nothing more than juvenile angst, that a few years of maturity will, ‘sort out’. On the flip side, I feel everything he feels, which in actual fact makes my original point slightly redundant. **Maul**’s music is humbling because it becomes appropriate to everyone and anyone. Problems linger throughout life, insecurities stay rooted, **Maul**, despite his age already knows this and he in a way wants to remind us.\n\n_I Don’t Wanna B Judged_ is featured on **Hot Sugar**‘s _Midi Murder EP_, which features **100s, Antwon, Das Racist, Shady Blaze** and many more. It’s due for release through [Scion A/V](http://www.scionav.com/hotsugar) on Tuesday.\n\nStream it **[HERE](http://www.spin.com/blogs/hot-sugar-haleek-mauls-i-dont-wanna-be-judged-premiere)** ( via SPIN )",
