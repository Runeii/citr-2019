  "body": "**Kathleen Hanna** is cool as fuck.\n\nIf you disagree with, or the way it’s phrased, then unlucky; the mastermind of **Bikini Kill**, **Le Tigre** and reluctant icon has tirelessly been putting out some of the best material to embody the punk spirit for the past twenty odd years.\n\nThat’s why it’s great to see that, having [conquered an all together quite nasty sounding bout of illness](http://www.spin.com/articles/julie-ruin-kathleen-hanna-cover-story-august-2013/), she’s come straight back with the new **Julie Ruin** material she teased at a few years back. We seemed to miss covering _Oh Come On _when it was released a couple of months back, so we’re not missing new single _Ha Ha Ha. _\n\nFans of her earlier work won’t find any huge surprises here, but I don’t mean that in a bad way. This is scuzzy, energetic garage rock with Hanna’s trademark hyperactive half-sung, half-screamed vocals making it impossible to not play it at full volume.\n\nGive it a spin below alongside personal favourite _A Place Called Won’t Be There; _a scruffier, rawer cut from the original Julie Ruin album back in 1998, breakbeat percussion, minimal guitar and all.\n\nTheir album _Run Fast _is out 3rd September via TJR Records.\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/102450312″ params=”” width=” 100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/102559335″ params=”” width=” 100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]",
