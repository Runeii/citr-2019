Now, with the year drawing to a close, **Mike Hadreas** has dropped a teaser from his upcoming sophomore album, as well as confirming the track-listing and release date.\n\nNew track _All Waters_ showcases a more expansive sound, deviating from the heavy reliance upon the melancholic piano, and adding a level of ambient atmosphere. **Hadreas’s** vocals are as perfect as ever, combining with the lyrics to portray a heartfelt sense of longing and lust. _**Put Your Back N 2**_ It will be available from Feb 20, via [**Turnstile Music**](http://www.turnstilemusic.net/perfumegeniusnewalbum/), check out _All Waters_ below and head over [here](http://tinyurl.com/PerfumeGenius-AllWaters) for a free download.\n\n [Perfume Genius – All Waters](http://soundcloud.com/dummymag/perfume-genius-all-waters) by [DummyMag](http://soundcloud.com/dummymag)\n\n_**Put Your Back N 2 It**_ tracklisting:\n\n_1\\.
