  "body": "_**Aliso**_, the debut album from **Malena Zavala** is shaping up to be rather special.\n\nWith last years singles Should I Try and If It Goes demonstrating her phenomenal songwriting talent, most recent release, _A Vision That’s Changed_ again showcases her unique writing prowess. Poignant and wistful, this feels like a love song at its core, yet tinged with an almost psych-pop edge; it’s as moving as anything else I’ve heard this year. Check it out below. Aliso is released 13 April through [Yucatan Records](http://radi.al/Aliso).",
