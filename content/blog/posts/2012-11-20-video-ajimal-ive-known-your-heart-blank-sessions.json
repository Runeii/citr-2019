  "body": "Photo: Ian West\n\nThe music of **Ajimal** is almost unnervingly mystical, never fully betraying the complex vocal structures that inform each track, yet diving mercilessly to the emotional core and tugging savagely on the heartstrings.\n\nThis bewitching new session recorded at Blank Studios finds **Fran O’Hanlon** accompanied by Mark, Matt and Ben from North East group **Tessera Skies**, adding an extra level of fragile density, to both the instrumental and vocal sections. Touches of **Bon Iver** and **Jeff Buckley** ring true throughout, however **Ajimal** sculpts an illimitable soundscape that is entirely his own. With a new mini-album entitled **_Childhood_** out early 2013, this immensely talented young songwriter is sure to have one hell of a year.",
