  "body": "Having enchanted on their debut track [_Ghost_](www.</p><p>crackintheroad.com/music/27536-new-autumn-ghost/) little under a month ago, Aus duo **Autumn** return with the b-side to the release. _Breathe Out_ focuses again on the exquisite vocals of Jay Kane, built around the sort of luxurious atmosphere we’ve come to expect from the likes of BANKS or Purity Ring. Yet another hugely promising step for the two-piece, and further indication that the vibrant electronic scene in Australia is here to stay.",
