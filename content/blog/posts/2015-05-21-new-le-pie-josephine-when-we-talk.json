  "date": "2015-05-21T17:19:05",
  "body": "**le Pie’s** debut track, Secrets, put her alongside a host of hugely exciting artists emerging from Australia, and saw her earning play on their [Triple J Unearthed](https://www.</p><p>triplejunearthed.com/) service. Returning, with two brand new tracks, Josephine and When We Talk, she’s further asserted her position as an artist to keep an eye on. Of the two, Josephine is a Lana Del Rey indebted ballad; romantic and lustful, whereas When We Talk is a grungier affair, arguably the more compelling of the duo. Check out both below.\n\nFollow our [Spotify On Repeat playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a hand-picked selection of the current hottest tracks.",
