Where his highly recommended debut EP _**No Bloke**_ took a more straightforward glo-wave direction, this new cut appears to be trialing new sounds and methods, to sumptuous effect. With more new material on the way, and a debut physical release just around the corner, I’m eagerly anticipating watching **Noble Oak** spread his branches.\n\n [The Mydriatic Sea](http://soundcloud.com/nobleoak/the-mydriatic-sea) by [Noble Oak](http://soundcloud.com/nobleoak)",
