  "body": "I came across ‘What happens in the Summer lasts Forever’ when writing a feature for another site, and after further investigation I couldn’t find any form of social media outlet for **Châteaux**, leaving me with only the track and the name **George Flint** as my foundation of knowledge for the band.\n\nNeedless to say, I became thoroughly intrigued.\n\nBeginning with infectious and interwoven guitars, Flint‘s vocals enter the track with a subdued nostalgia, before erupting into an emphatic chorus of renewed hope and determination. With the tag ‘Beach House’, the track does represent a certain vibe that does pertain to the pure fun and sun kissed optimism of time spent on the beach. Standing as the band’s first effort, after what seems like a period of more folk orientated creativity, it’ll be interesting to see how **Flint** & co built on this jaunty, lo-fi sound.",
