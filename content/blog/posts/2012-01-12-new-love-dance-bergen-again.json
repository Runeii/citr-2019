This new track from [**Love, Dance**](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Love-Dance-official/152334838115398?sk=wall) sort of reminds me of those times, before **Johnny Pierce** thought he was **Morrissey** and began acting like an arsehole. Anyway, _Bergen, Again_ is a sugary sweet indie-pop gem, taking fairly noticeable inspiration from **The Cure** and **The Smiths**, as well as a slight whiff of **Pale Saints**. With more songs in the works, I’m pretty excited to hear what **Love, Dance** are going to come up with next, so, as they themselves brilliantly paraphrase **Notorious B.I.G.** in the final lines of _Bergen, Again_, ‘_if you don’t know, now you know_‘.\n\n [Love Dance – Bergen, again](http://soundcloud.com/increasethepeace/love-dance-bergen-again) by [IncreaseThePeace](http://soundcloud.com/increasethepeace)",
