  "body": "**How To Dress Well’s** sophomore effort is undoubtedly one of the most hotly anticipated records of 2012 amongst the indiesphere.\n\nWith very little new material since his 2010 debut, _Ocean Floor For Everything_ is a welcome return, and continues in his characteristic ethereal nature, awash with melancholic piano sections and reverb heavy vocals. Check it out below and grab a free download while you can.\n\n**How To Dress Well’s** second LP _Total Loss_ will see it’s release in September.",
