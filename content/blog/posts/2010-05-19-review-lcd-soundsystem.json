Being the follow on from 2007’s imperious _Sound of Silver_ has increased those expectations even further.  \nWhen you proclaim your forthcoming record to be your final release whilst your previous album has been hailed as a masterpiece, the pressure is truly on to deliver a landmark groundbreaking album. So, has **James Murphy** made his career defining epochal record with _This Is Happening_? Unfortunately the answer is no. While _Sound of Silver_ was indisputably great and a true leap forward both sonically and in terms of song writing. _This is Happening_ is merely a good record, no shame in that but after what has gone before it is a slight let down.  \n_This is Happening_ is the sound of a man trying to recapture past glories in a similar style as before. Having hit upon a winning formula of thrilling dance floor dynamics aligned to heart wrenching emotional laments with _Sound of Silver_, _This Is Happening_ uses much the same template and tricks, the **Bowie** pastiches are in place, the art rock retreads are there, as are the propulsive techno tracks and witty diatribes. There is nothing here that **LCD** fans have not heard before, the law of diminishing returns very much applies. Where the previous album sparkled and was full of rich emotional depth and subtly, many of the tracks here just drift by in a haze of mundanity. Only two tracks are less than seven minutes long, this is a record to test the patience of even the most ardent fan.\n\nDespite the feeling that much of the music here is a retread of what has gone before, make no mistake there is some outstanding music on this record. The album is bookended by two tracks that show both sides of the **LCD** oeuvre, both genius in terms of their style and execution. _Dance Yrself Clean_ stars in a low key manner with the sound of what appears to be rattling pots and pans alongside bare bones percussion, **Murhpy**’**s** typically oblique lyrics ramble on about friends being mean, people being jerks and various other phrases while lilting backing vocals coo around him. The song is then pulverised by a massive techno explosion as synths blast and drums thud and kick, it is genuinely striking and by far the most exciting moment of the album. _Dance Yrself Clean_ is unique in being the only really truly original track on the album and it shows why **James Murphy** has one of the greatest dance music minds on the planet. The final track _Home_ shows the other side of the **LCD** coin, it is a truly beautiful record full of heart and soul, distilling the music to its pure beauty with no need for pointless witticism or an over egged synthy pudding. A simple hymn to accepting life for what it is, it is a really sweet track and perhaps the only point in the record that comes close to the emotional majesty of career highpoint _All My Friends_.  \nWhile many points of the album appear to lack innovation, one area where there is clear development is **Murphy’s** voice, it sounds superb throughout the whole album, most apparent on the lovely electro ballad _I Can Change_.  \nDespite the excellence of the previously mentioned tracks, far too much of the album is mired in mediocrity, in particular the interminable bad joke of _You Wanted A Hit_ and the throwaway electro dance punk of _Drunk Girls_ it is a malaise that severely drags the record down.  \nAfter listening to _This Is Happening,_ it is quickly apparent that the dissolution of the **LCD Soundsytem** name is perhaps not such a bad thing and if he is ever to reach the heights of _Sound of Silver_ again **James Murphy** has to look forward and expand his musical palette, as there is no doubt he is one of the most talented and creative musicians on the planet but from the sound of this record it appears **LCD Soundsystem** may not the be best outlet for his talent anymore.\n\n[Official Site](http://lcdsoundsystem.com/thelimitedpack/)\n\n[Check Out LCD Soundsystem’s Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/lcdsoundsystem)",
