  "body": "After being seriously impressed upon my [first listen](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/20200-feature-predictably-good-swedish-music/ \"Predictably good Swedish music\") to **Little Children** a few weeks back, the release of new track _Distant Shouts_ is very welcome indeed. Fresh from supporting fellow countrymen **Shout Out Louds** on their U.S tour and  plying his trade in Austin at SXSW, Stockholm resident **Linus Lutti** let us hear his project’s new song online  at the end of last week.\n\nApparently the track was recorded for American hospital drama _Grey’s Anatomy,_ which might explain the slight step-up in production value – I have no idea what kind-of scene it’s been used in (one can probably rule out anything too uplifting), but thankfully there’s been no compromise on quality. It’s another confident display of **Lutti’s** thoughtful and emotive songwriting – rather than any TV show association, it should just go further in marking **Little Children** as a band to watch out for.
