  "body": "This new cut from **Memoryhouse** will close the re-issue of their forthcoming EP **_The Years_**, out mid September on **Sub Pop**.\n\nAs well as making _Quiet America_ available for free download; the Ontario duo have provided a video to accompany it, directed by female vocalist **Denise Nouvion**. The track is a dream pop gem, and much like we’ve come to expect from Memoryhouse, is largely lead by **Nouvion’s** magnificent vocals. Placid piano chords and melancholic violins guide _Quiet America_ on it’s way, whilst the visually stunning video echoes the relaxing and tranquil feel to the track. Check out the video below, or head over to the **Memoryhouse** [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/memoryhouse) to download _Quiet America_ for free.\n\n[Quiet America](http://vimeo.com/27361175) from [memoryhouse](http://vimeo.com/memoryhouse) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
