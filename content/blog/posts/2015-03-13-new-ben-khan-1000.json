  "body": "Paying homage to André 3000 on his newest track, _1000_, **Ben Khan** sets his stall out for 2015 in style.\n\nWith his debut live shows now just around the corner (see you in Paris), the Londoner has announced a new EP, featuring four previously unheard tracks. As frenetic and energetic as his first EP, it’s truly the sign of an artist carving out his own sound; amidst a sea of musicians attempting to capture a similar aesthetic, there’s now no doubt that Ben Khan is standing head and shoulders above the rest. Check out 1000 below, and pre-order the EP [here](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/1000-ep/id975147980).",
