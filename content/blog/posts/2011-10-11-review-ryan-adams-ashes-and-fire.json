Earlier this year, at the release of long-standing favourite Death Cab for Cutie’s latest effort **_Codes and Keys_**, [I bemoaned the Washington quartet’s newfound emotional distance](http://robhollamby.tumblr.com/post/10767741923/death-cab-for-cutie-codes-and-keys \"Ooh, Rob has a Tumblr you say? What's that? No I am not a 'fifteen-year-old girl'. Oh, piss off and give it a follow, will you?\"), where, say, **_All Eternals Deck_** by The Mountain Goats presented a 2011 release that [I could really get sad to](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azZDtf50pNQ \"Seriously. Contender for sad song of the year.\"). However juvenile or self-indulgent or retrogressive it may seem, I am a semi-bashful devotee of those records that do well soundtracking lonesome, late night whiskey drinking and overflowing ashtrays. **Ryan Adams**, I think we can all agree, has proved himself a past master at making exactly those sorts of records.\n\nYou can probably see where this is going. That **_Ashes and Fire_**, Adams’ thirteenth studio album, and first since leaving The Cardinals in 2009, begins with the line ‘last time I was here it was raining, it’s not raining any more’, is particularly fitting. Adams has been keen to dismiss the idea that his songs should be taken as a literal extension of what he’s feeling at any given time, telling [Drowned In Sound](http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4143701-i%E2%80%99m-always-in-a-good-place-when-i%E2%80%99m-working-on-music-dis-meets-ryan-adams \"Am I allowed to do this? I am now. \")‘s David Edwards simply “I’m always in a good place when I’m working on music”. So it’s not necessarily Adams’ marriage to Mandy Moore, or his positive decision to continue with music in the face of Ménière’s Disease, that have contributed to the more relaxed themes and sound present on **_Ashes and Fire_**, as one might have expected. But true or not, the notion certainly seems applicable.\n\nThe Cardinals must’ve had a hard time of it, rarely critically respected as anything more than Adams’ competent but relatively unremarkable backing band. That said, their mark on those albums they played on is indelible – it’s particularly clear that **_Ashes and Fire_** is not a Cardinals record, largely consisting as it does of strummed acoustics, gentle percussion, and nary a country thrashathon in sight. The lack of musical urgency on **_Ashes and Fire_** influenced my early judgment of the album – where a song like _Save Me_ isn’t particularly cheerful in tone, it’s gentle, gospel-inflected sound certainly doesn’t elevate it to _Meadowlake Street_‘s miserable heights. With the customary vitriol I reserve for artists who _dare_ to go even the slightest bit happier on me, I was perfectly ready to write off **_Ashes and Fire_** as unremarkable and await the next release that would pander to my ridiculous demands.\n\nA reassessment of values was needed at this point. Obviously, dismissing an album as poor simply because it’s not as tearjerking as an artist’s previous output would be ridiculous, self-indulgent, and probably downright unhealthy as well. For a start, there are undeniably a scattering of those moments on **_Ashes and Fire_** that can light a sad-addict up inside, not least on _Come Home_, which is just as longing as it’s similarly-titled counterpart from **_Cold Roses_**, and the title track puts paid to any notions that Adams can’t do rollicking without the Cardinals. Similarly, both _Do I Wait_ and _Lucky Now_ are as good as anything that Adams has ever produced before, the former blooming from soft beginnings into something altogether more substantial, and the latter the closest he’s got to _**Pneumonia**_ in years. So it’s a little unfortunate that the second half of the **_Ashes and Fire_** does have a tendency toward indistinctness. The aforementioned _Save Me_, _Kindness_, and the closing _I Love You But I Don’t Know What To Say_ are all relatively lengthy, end-credits numbers that schmooze softly into each other with the minimum of effect, whatever the sentiment behind them.\n\n**_Ashes and Fire_** is not Ryan Adams’ best record, emotional calibre notwithstanding. That said, it’s certainly not his worst either, and taking the record out of the context of a critical review for a moment, it’s delightful to hear the man sounding so settled, especially with his battle with Ménière’s Disease in mind. Trading in bourbon-soaked self-destruction for the kind of gentle jams that your parents could quite happily nod their heads to without getting too involved seems to me to have sapped much of the vitality from Adams’ music. But hell, maybe I’m just not ready to stop being a miserable fucker just yet.",
