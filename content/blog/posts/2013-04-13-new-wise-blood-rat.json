Rat, the first track taken from **_id_**, premiered via [The Fader](http://www.thefader.com/2013/04/10/stream-wise-blood-rat/) alongside a short interview, is a colourful, frantic slice of tropical pop. With the near rap delivery, not too disimilar to **WHY?**, and **Idiot Glee** style instrumental sections, it’s more than enough to get me very excited for **_id_**.",
