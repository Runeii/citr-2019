  "body": "**BLACKSMORE**.\n\nHardly the most appealing name for a producer, especially once combined with the fairly eerie imagery. However, **Thomas Blacksmore** has far more depth to his music than the dark visual element would suggest. His debut EP _**YOUTH**_ is seven tracks of instrumental chillwave, built around contagious hooks and carefully structured percussion. Whilst at times it may lack personality, with a fairly similar atmosphere being expressed in each track, there are moments of pure bliss, most notably the sensational _DREAMS_.\n\nAs indicated by **BLACKSMORE**, these songs are merely a collection of demos, however the potential they portray is astounding. _DREAMS_ has the sort of dancefloor-filler riff that **M83** would kill for, whilst _HOLIDAYS_ drifts by with it’s lulling, repetitive nature. Clearly a work in progress, there’s no doubting that at times _**YOUTH**_ lacks a certain charisma, however theres no denying the vast ability it displays. Check out _DREAMS_ below, and head to **BLACKSMORE’s** [bandcamp](http://blacksmore.bandcamp.com/) to stream the full release.\n\n<a href=\"http://blacksmore.bandcamp.com/track/dreams-demo\">DREAMS (DEMO) by BLACKSMORE</a>",
