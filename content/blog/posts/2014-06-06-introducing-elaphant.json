  "body": "New York five piece **ELAPHANT** know their way around a killer chorus and an addictive melody. On their fantastic debut self-titled EP, they yo-yo from the Foo Fighters sounding opener _Invader_, to the far more intimate, yet equally impressive, _Torn Limbs_. Expansive, bold, and verging upon anthemic, it’s the sort of crossover you could imagine enticing the indie crowd, whilst simultaneously wowing colossal festival crowds. Stick this on repeat, ‘cus it’s one of the best EPs of the year. Check out all five tracks below.\n\n<a href=\"http://elaphant.bandcamp.com/album/elaphant\">ELAPHANT by Elaphant</a>",
