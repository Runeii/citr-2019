  "body": "It’s clear from the outset that Pennsylvania trio **Voyeurs** (Brendan Bormes – Piano/Vocals, Dillon Cason – Guitars/Vocals, Mike Iorio – Drums) don’t take themselves all too seriously.\n\nFrom describing themselves as “piling something less perishable than moonward ululations on the bulwark against mortality”, to belittling their vocals as ‘Matt Berninger rip-offs’, it’s all done rather tongue in cheek, even the pre-chorus ‘ohhhh’s’ feel a little forced. Hell, that piano line is rather hilarious at times. Yet strangely enough, it all actually serves to make their debut outing, _HVP_, all the more appealing. So The National reference is there to be heard, perhaps not as strong as they assume, instead it’s influences from The Killers and Springsteen that shine through. Where HVP really flexes it’s muscles is through it’s lyrics, which I’m sure Berninger himself would be proud of – “you were in the car / burned into my skin / how was I to know / stretched across the sky / piss drunk chasing fireflies”.",
