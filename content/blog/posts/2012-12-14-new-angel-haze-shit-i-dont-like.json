Her [collaboration](https://soundcloud.com/angelhazeym/gimme-that-prod-by-lunice) with the producer [**Lunice**](https://www.facebook.com/lunicefp) was perhaps a highlight, a grandiose, stonking jam that cemented her as a firm ‘on to watch’ in 2013. In a year that started with **[Azealia Banks](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/16927-new-azealia-banks-aquababe-produced-by-machinedrum/ \"New: Azealia Banks – Aquababe (Produced by Machinedrum)\")**, it’s encouraging to see a female MC end the year with a bit more substance. Her new cut/demo sees her take on [**Chief Keef**’s](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WcRXJ4piHg) ‘_I don’t like’_. Her flow is quick, sharp and as always, firmly on point.\n\n2013: the year of Angel Haze.",
