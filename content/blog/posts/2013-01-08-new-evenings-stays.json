  "body": "**[Evenings](https://www.facebook.com/Eveningsounds)** has been an artist that unites the writers at CitR for a long time now. His 2011 record, _Lately_, had us on the floor, literally, begging for life to always be this damn good. Sort of.\n\nRecently **Evenings** announced that, as he puts it, he would be “laying low”. The world does a little cry. Now me and **Evenings** might have slightly different opinions on what constitutes “laying Low”, but I’d assume that to most of the world it doesn’t mean; release a six minute, part soundscape, part soundtrack, part found sound jazz jam.\n\nI’m glad Evenings doesn’t know what “laying Low” means.\n\n_Stays_ is part of the [**Friends of Friends**](http://www.fofmusic.net/) compilation ‘Show Me The Future’, which is released next week.",
