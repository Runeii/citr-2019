  "body": "With only one track and an Essential Zones Mixtape to their name, Brooklyn’s **Young Diamonds** (Bob Maynard and Michael Wolfson) are fresh out the chillwave womb.\n\nTheir debut outing _Innocent Wave_ is a vibrant blend of 80’s pop such as **Depeche Mode** and **The Pet Shop Boys** stirred with a healthy dose of more modern ‘alternative’ artists ala **Neon Indian** and **Tanlines**. The vocals are at times slightly less slick than the instrumental sections yet for a first attempt, it’s a mightily impressive one. As anthemic as it is understated, I really hope this isn’t the last we hear of **Young Diamonds**.
