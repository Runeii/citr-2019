  "body": "Formerly known as **ttthick as ttthieves**, and now reborn as [**Nightlives**](http://www.facebook.com/Nightlives), Brent and Jordan from Toronto are set to release their debut LP [**_A Wink In The Face Of Death_**](http://www.awinkinthefaceofdeath.com/) later this month. With considered black and white imagery and slightly mysterious press photos, Nightlives have all the makings of a future internet sensation, following in the footsteps of the likes of **The Neighbourhood** and **KO KO** (now known as **Pacific Air**). Debut single _Underneath_ is a twisted pop gem, fusing shoegaze influences with slicker electronic elements to master a swirling behemoth of a track that crescendo’s to a cacophony of reverb heavy guitars and midi drum samples, yet with an addictive undertone. It may be a relatively simple sound, but boy do they nail it. Check out _Underneath_ below, and grab a free download from their [bandcamp](http://nightlives.bandcamp.com/), as well as the first album teaser.\n\n[NIGHTLIVES – A Wink in the Face of Death – Teaser 1](http://vimeo.com/48477028) from [Nightlives](http://vimeo.com/nightlives) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
