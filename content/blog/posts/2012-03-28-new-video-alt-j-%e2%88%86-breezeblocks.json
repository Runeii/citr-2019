Or perhaps it’s a joke at the expense of Mac-touting, triangle sporting hipsters? But then again, they’re the only demographic that would actually get the joke; so really, it’s a joke at the expensive of the mainstream, who happen, god forbid, to not know that typing alt-j into a mac will produce a ∆. They’re going to hell.\n\nEither way, the new video for their new single, _Breezeblocks_, directed by _Ellis Bahl_, is fucking fantastic.\n\n24 May – Academy 2, Dublin  \n25 May – The Stiff Kitten, Belfast  \n26 May – The Harley Sheffield  \n28 May – Arts College, Glasgow  \n29 May – The Cluny 2, Newcastle  \n30 May – The Hare & Hounds, Birmingham  \n01 June – The Cooler, Bristol\n\nPresale tickets [HERE.](http://www.facebook.com/altJ.band/app_137800769578239)",
