  "body": "With the release of their sophomore album _**Rooms Filled With Light**_ just around the corner (28 February), London quintet **Fanfarlo** have made the records bonus track _Vostok, I Know You Are Waiting_, available to hear.\n\nIt’s a delicate, vocal driven number, with lead singer Simon Balthazar picking apart his inner feelings over the top of a minimal instrumental section. _‘They say it’ll make me sleep easier at night’_ is a lyric delivered with downtrodden turmoil and an endearing sense of self-pity, sure to warm the coldest of hearts. Stream _Vostok, I Know You Are Waiting Below_.",
