  "body": "_‘Maybe she’ll sink, maybe she’ll fly, I’ve got a witch that cries all the time’_\n\nAnd so begins this superb gem of a track, created my London newcomers RES.\n\nReminiscent of Local Natives, first album Cults, and even a bit of The Doors, ‘She’s A Witch’ is one hundred and sixty seconds of ceaselessly engaging, upbeat music. The repetitive chorus has a truly addictive quality, and the brief taste of an instrumental section at the end of the track is begging to be further explored and enjoyed. The band have a selection of other tracks available to stream, and they only go further to demonstrate their considerable level of potential.\n\nVery little information is currently available about Res, however I’m in no doubt it wont be long until you start hearing more and more about this exciting new outfit.",
