  "body": "By now we know what to expect from **Athletes In Paris**; laddish swagger, light-hearted playfulness and stonking indie anthems that practically demand you to sing along to them.\n\nIn fact, for their new video _Echoes Louder Than Voices_ that’s precisely what they’ve encouraged, taking to the streets and filming members of the public mouthing the lyrics to the track. There’s your typical shyness from some (0.42), an exuberance from others (0.26) and my personal favourite (1.22) that, well, you’ll just have to see for yourself. Check out the video below, and grab a free download of the track from the [**Athletes In Paris** bandcamp](http://athletesinparis.bandcamp.com/).",
