  "date": "2012-02-07T17:59:29",
  "body": "This new gem from Bournemouth’s **YOOFS** is quite unlike anything else coming from the UK at the moment.\n\nIf truth be told, it would probably fit in better amongst some of the scuzz-pop acts crawling out of the Brooklyn woodwork. That’s not a criticism of the track by any means, as it’s a wonderful four minutes of shimmering indie pop, drawing from shoegaze inspirations on the guitars alongside the ballad-esque vocal delivery, making for a thoroughly engaging listen. Check _HAZY DAYZ_ out below.\n\n_HAZY DAYZ_ is out now via [The Sounds Of Sweet Nothing](http://thesoundsofsweetnothing.bandcamp.com/track/hazy-dayz)",
