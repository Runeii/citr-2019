  "body": "WU LYF have been gone a couple of years now, but that doesn’t stop their influence being heard.\n\nSwedish outfit YOUTHCULT who released an EP about this time last year, somewhat sarcastically titled YOUTH CUNT, have returned with their most coherent music to date, in the form of new EP W E W. So the WU LYF inspiration is at times, a little over the top, especially on opening track, Whatever Works, combining the ethereal beauty of fellow Mancunian’s MONEY, with the rousing, raw nature of the Go Tell Fire heavy-pop outfit. Check out the lead track below, alongside the rest of the EP.\n\n<a href=\"http://ythclt.bandcamp.com/album/w-e-w\">W E W by YOUTHCULT</a>",
