  "body": "Remember Art Brut? What about Elle Milano? Seattle trio **Scarves** embody that same loveably raw and twee lyrical playfulness that the aforementioned acts thrived upon.\n\nWith their debut three track EP, entitled **_TV_**, they boldly demonstrate their unique personality, most notably through the story-telling ambition within each track, be it the lovelorn _Tag!_ or the angst-y _Broken Branches_. Lines such as ‘you used to skate for jesus, but now you think that someone else always see us, all the pamphlets in your back pocket, don’t help’, maintain their adorably twee status, whilst hinting at a darker element to the trio. Check out the EP below.",
