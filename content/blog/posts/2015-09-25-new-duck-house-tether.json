  "date": "2015-09-25T15:02:17",
  "body": "Taken from Duck House’s upcoming EP, ‘Tether’ has a Balearic flavour while handpicking pop sensibilities as an undeniably catchy chorus is wrapped around a variety of sparking synth sounds.\n\nThere is a definite sense of development in Duck House’s sound, especially given this is the first piece of original material to emerge in the past year. In the interim he dropped a superb Ellie Goulding remix of ‘Love Me Like You Do’, and in moving forward with ‘Tether’ there are accompanying [live dates](http://www.duckhousemusic.co.uk/shows.html) which help fully realise the potential of this quickly emerging project.",
