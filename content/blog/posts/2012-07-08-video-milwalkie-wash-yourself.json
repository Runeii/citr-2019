  "body": "Having been in previous musical outfits before, it appears that Berlin’s **Milwalkie** have settled upon a shape that they’re truly comfortable to inhabit.\n\n_Wash Yourself_, the first single taken from their forthcoming sophomore record, is a synth driven dream pop gem, drawing from the likes of **Twin Shadow** and **Washed Out** to imagine a track so perfectly rounded that it’s impossible to not view it as their finest work to date. Check out the beautifully shot video directed by **Rocco Lacitignola** below and keep up with **Milwalkie** via their [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/Milwalkie).",
