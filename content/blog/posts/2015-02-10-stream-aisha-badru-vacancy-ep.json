  "date": "2015-02-10T17:06:29",
  "body": "Towards the tail end of last year, NY’s **Aisha Badru** unveiled her debut original offering, in the form of the beautiful Waiting Around, a simple yet endearing composition.\n\nWith her debut EP, she showcases further proof of her songwriting abilities, despite the production levels being far from top of the range, her vocals and knack for penning addictive love songs stand out. Much like [Lilla Vargen](www.crackintheroad.com/music/30691-introducing-lilla-vargen), it’s the potential that stands out the most. Check out the full EP below, featuring personal favourite, Vacancy.",
