  "title": "New: Elvis Depressedly – Daughter Of A Cop / A Bible In A Bath of Bleach",
  "date": "2012-02-21T23:54:03",
  "body": "Having reversed his initial decision to kill **Coma Cinema**, the moniker under which he originally made his name, **Mat Cothran** made it clear that there would be some major changes coming relating to his side-project **Elvis Depressedly**.\n\nNow having tweaked his two EPs into one single release, and made it available through iTunes, **Cothran** has stayed true to his word by releasing a couple more free tracks. Recorded for **Glamour Kills Clothing**, the four track _**GLMR KLLS EP**_ is available for free via their [official website](http://www.glamourkills.com/blog/?p=2803).\n\n_Daughter Of A Cop_ is a delicate, folk inspired number, with Mat’s usual drawl and stunning lyrical ability allowing the track to develop a unique personality. _A Bible In A Bath of Bleach_ uses a similar beat, but slightly sped up, and is very **Coma Cinema**\\-esque in nature, not a bad thing of course. Check out _A Bible In A Bath Of Bleach_ below, and grab the three track EP for free [here](http://www.glamourkills.com/blog/?p=2803).",
