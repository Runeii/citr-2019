  "body": "With all (the important) CitR Bros over in Austin putting the final touches together for our SXSW showcase tomorrow at BD Riley’s, I’m once again a lonely solitary blogger chatting about tunes Josh has already heard.\n\nGod I hate myself.\n\nAnyway, **Big K.R.I.T** has sampled **James Blake**’s cavernously doubtful _Wilhelms Scream_ hook, “_I don’t know about my dreams_”, into this remarkably introspective and honest new track, _R.E.M_. It works dramatically well considering the original material is only a couple of years old, and at the very least its making feel slightly better about not being in Austin, I probably wouldn’t enjoy myself anyway.",
