Now, electronic four piece Shades are looking to add their name to that stellar list. Having already featured on CitR with their track Hard Fall, only a week or so ago, they are back with another new song, in the form of surf pop gem Ghostlike. The vocals are ethereal and soaked with honest yearning, whilst the synths sidle along gloriously. With three excellent tracks to their name now, Shades are well on course to cement their name in their fantastic Boise music scene. Listen to and download Ghostlike below.\n\n [Ghostlike](http://soundcloud.com/shadesmusic/ghostlike) by [Shades.](http://soundcloud.com/shadesmusic)",
