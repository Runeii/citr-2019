Far more stripped back than anything One Direction have done, it’s more Bon Iver than chart-topping hit, and you know what, were it not for his history, other blogs would be going crazy over this. Stick King Krule, Jamie Isaac or SOAK on this and you’ve got a Hype Machine #1. Check out _I Won’t Mind_ below.",
