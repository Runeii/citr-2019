  "title": "New: Bad Wave – 3 AM",
  "date": "2016-08-04T19:38:44",
  "body": "Having released a handful of singles over the course of the past year or so, LA duo **Bad Wave** (Patrick Hart and Tucker Tota) have already sculpted a rather unique sound for themselves.\n\nMerging the pop sensibilities of the likes of Phoenix and MGMT, with more odd-pop, dare I even say psychedelic tendencies, it’s an expansive and ambitious sound, as demonstrated expertly on recent single _3AM_. Colourful, glittering indie pop, it manages to sound slick without becoming too safe, yet remaining thoroughly enjoyable. Check out 3AM below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
