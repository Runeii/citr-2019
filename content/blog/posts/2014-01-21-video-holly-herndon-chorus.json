Seemingly melting MacBook’s, flying staplers and twisted dimensions, it’s an absolute mindfuck, not to mention it being soundtracked boy some of the most bizarre yet heavenly music you’ll hear this year. In Herndon’s own words: “So much of Chorus was constructed by spying on my own online habits. It felt fitting to invite Akihiko, who I had been spying on online for a long time before my approach, to contribute the visual treatment of the piece.”",
