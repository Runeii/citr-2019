A cleaner and more polished sound, it’s dreamy, whilst remaining engaging, not just simply floating by. The initial collection of tracks (A,B,C & D) felt like the trailer to something rather special, and _Don’t Sleep_ begins to bring the early potential to a form of realisation. Thanks to [DIY](http://www.thisisfakediy.co.uk/articles/news/premiere-listen-attu-stream-dont-sleep-single/) for the premiere.",
