  "date": "2017-08-30T15:20:30",
  "body": "Having caught an early break with a remix of Bon Iver’s Michicant which reached the ears of Justin Vernon himself, Toronto producer and songwriter **Nightshifts** is now stepping out with his own material.\n\nHis debut offering, _All Along_, manages to maintain all the sincerity of it’s almost lo-fi roots, whilst feeling resounding confident and polished. Recorded after a move downtown and “before I had any furniture; just sitting on the floor with my guitar, mics, and synths.”, it’s this honesty that really sets it aside from many contemporaries; it’s a love song at it’s core and that really shines through.",
