Pulp’s frontman, radio presenter & all-round working class hero Jarvis Cocker  previously described Jeffrey Lewis as **“**The best lyricist working in the US today.**”**\n\n“We might need to dress up for this one” the post on Jeffrey Lewis & the Junkyard’s facebook read but this isn’t the first time Cocker & Lewis have shared a billing. Back in 2008 they [toured together](http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=125&title=jeffrey_lewis_on_tour_with_jarvis_cocker&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1) (Jeff actually wrote an article about it for NME) and both played solo sets at [Rough Trade’s 25th Anniversary](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/nov/30/jarvis-cocker-jeffrey-lewis-rough-trade).",
