  "body": "These debut three tracks from LA’s **Wild Paws** are about as close to a definition of modern lo-fi as you’re going to get.\n\nPlenty of echoed vocals and hazy shoegaze inspired guitar lines make for wonderfully romanticized tracks, that are more than worthy of repeated listens. Their self-titled EP is a collection of lovelorn tracks, written to soundtrack breaking up, making up and making out. Opener _Pancakes_ is a five and a half minute epic, combining male and female vocals to glorious effect, with the two singers crooning ‘_be my baby tonight_‘.\n\nThere’s touches of **The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart** on _Run_, yet more spaced out and lethargic, relying heavily on the electronic percussion section. Despite it still being very early in **Wild Paws** career, this trio of tracks is more than enough to show the potential these guys have. Check out Pancakes below and head over to their [bandcamp](http://wildpaws.bandcamp.com/) to hear the other two cuts.\n\n<a href=\"http://wildpaws.bandcamp.com/track/pancakes\">Pancakes by Wild Paws</a>",
