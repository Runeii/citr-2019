  "body": "I’m still to fully buy into **The Weeknd**; whilst I can appreciate his production skills, it’s clear he has a long way to go before he reaches the same level with his overall product as **Drake**.\n\nAnyway, this fantastic cover by Orlando musician **SASKATCHEWAN** is well worthy of hearing, ditching the sleazy atmosphere and turning _The Morning_ into a delicate, dreampop gem. Smooth vocals compliment a gently picked guitar, whilst the refrain around 3.45 is simply stunning. Check out _The Morning_ below.\n\n [SASKATCHEWAN – The Morning (The Weeknd Cover)](http://soundcloud.com/saskatchewan/the-morning-the-weeknd-cover) by [Saskatchewan](http://soundcloud.com/saskatchewan)",
