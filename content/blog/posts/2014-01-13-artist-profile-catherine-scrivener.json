  "body": "Catherine Scrivener is another artist in STITCH, an exhibition which Crack In The Road is following the lead up to, and also reviewing.\n\n[Catherine Scrivener ](http://catscriv.wordpress.com/)and I were interns together at Hotshoe in 2011. Two years later, I have founded ‘[Stitch](https://www.facebook.com/stitchexhibitions)’, which will feature her photography. The exhibition will be at Cock’n’Bull Gallery downstairs at the Tramshed in Shoreditch, running from January 16th to February 7th, 2014.\n\nHer journey over these two years has been finding her feet in London and getting in touch with it and the people it holds. Now it is very clear that she has her finger on the pulse of the city, creating some of the most authentic, natural and witty photography I’ve ever come across.\n\nYou have to look at her images together, one after the other, to gain a sense of the narrative. Her work tells the ridiculous story of her everyday; the mundane becomes beautiful and foolish as she photographs sushi, nights out, cats, friends, a tiny unicorn cut out on the pavement and so on.\n\nCatherine will also be making zines for STITCH so get these at the Cock ‘n’ Bull Gallery anytime after the show opens. These booklets will hover over the line between keepsake and throwaway giving you a selection of her favorite work in a format that is the ideal way to showcase her work.\n\nhttp://catscriv.wordpress.com/\n\n[http://www.cocknbullgallery.com/?p=969](http://www.cocknbullgallery.com/?p=969)\n\n[http://cargocollective.com/stitchlondon](http://cargocollective.com/stitchlondon)",
