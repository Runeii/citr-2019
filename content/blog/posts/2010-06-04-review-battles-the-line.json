Um … well … with a new track on The Twilight Soundtrack of course. Despite the questionable method of releasing new track _The Line_, it is still brilliant to have the experimental rockers back. A steady drum beat signals the start of the song, with a funky guitar riff joining in shortly after, whilst **Tyondai Braxton’s** vocals are far more distinguishable than on 2007s _Mirrored_, and are formed from legible words, marking a change from their debut album. However, they still maintain their ever changing beats as well as offbeat guitar notes, with persistent ‘hey!”s ringing out during large parts of the song. All considered, _The Line_ is a welcome comeback from one of rocks most unconventional and forward thinking bands.\n\n[Download The Line](http://www.mediafire.com/?mqh2qmnoyx2)\n\n[](http://www.mediafire.com/?mqh2qmnoyx2)[Check out their Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/battlestheband)",
