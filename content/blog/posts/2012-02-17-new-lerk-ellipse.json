  "date": "2012-02-17T17:43:00",
  "body": "Since shuffling onto the scene a little under two weeks ago with his atmospheric debut track _Creation_, Boise producer **LERK** is back with more, in the form of the eclectic _Ellipse_.\n\nFlitting between sampled reverb vocals and tinkling synth sections, _Ellipse_ wouldn’t sound out of place on **Balam Acab’s** recent release, and certainly doesn’t pale in quality. Whilst _Creation_ could have been viewed as being beginners luck, this new track proves that **LERK** certainly has a sparklingly bright future ahead of him.",
