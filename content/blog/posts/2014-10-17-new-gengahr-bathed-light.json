  "body": "Caught **Gengahr** in Newcastle last week supporting Dry The River, and it’s pretty incredible how far they’ve come in a relatively short space of time, something perhaps most obvious in the audience reaction.\n\nThe songs sound fuller, the vocals more confident and there’s a real fluidity to the way they perform, with recent singles Fill My Gums With Blood and Powder merely forming part of a very strong set, as oppose to being centre pieces. _Bathed In Light_, the B-side to the aforementioned Powder is a twisted, darker number, proving eerily romantic in a way that only Nick Cave seems able to achieve.",
