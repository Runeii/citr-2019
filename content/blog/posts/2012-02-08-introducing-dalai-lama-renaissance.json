  "body": "Now while I praised the modern digital age of bandcamp and soundcloud for finding the wonderfully obscure, it was in the old fashion method of ‘face to face conversation’ that I came across **Dalai Lama Renaissance**.\n\nNow while that may somewhat taint any reputation I have as a blogger, I am entirely grateful to a bearded Belgian called Claus who put me on to **DLR**, as friends of his back in his home country.\n\n**DLR**‘s latest offering, ‘**80 BPM**‘ is a fantastic composition of laid back electronica, infused with softened vocals that are reminiscent of **James Blake**. Sparked with subtle moments of percussion and waves of electronic interjections, **DLR** have created a track that transcends an ethereal level of calm and feels inherently beautiful with every listen.",
