  "body": "This debut slice of upbeat indie pop from **Big Summer** might be one of the most exciting new tracks I’ve heard so far this year.\n\nAfter numerous listens over the past few days, I decided it was finally time to put my thoughts into ‘blog-form’. Almost sounding like it should be soundtracking a slightly cheesy American sit-com, it’s languid, beach-pop vibes are sure to earn it praise from all the slickest blogs, and certainly serve to keep me on the edge of my seat for future releases. Music this sunny could only come from Barcelona. Check out _Morning Sun_ below.",
