  "date": "2014-12-15T17:12:27",
  "body": "Glasgow’s **LILAC PIN** are at the centre of a blossoming music scene in the Scottish city, with their shadowy debut track, [Easy](https://soundcloud.</p><p>com/lilacpin/easy) clocking up a decent Soundcloud following and features from XFM and NME. Returning with their second offering, the duo look to launch themselves into 2015 with a real confidence. _Come Inside_ is even more murkily mysterious than their debut track, taking a very much modern pop sound and merging it with the sort of intimidating songwriting more commonly associated with the likes of Nick Cave, like a twisted, eerie version of London Grammar. Check it out below.",
