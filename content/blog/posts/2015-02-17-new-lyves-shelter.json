  "body": "It seems like a long time ago that London’s **Lyves** (Francesca Bergami) released her debut offering, Visions, despite it being well under a year.\n\nNine months on, as well as several decent support slots, and shows at Reading / Leeds Festival, she’s unveiled her second track, the sensually charged _Shelter_. I’m feeling some real FKA Twigs influence in the general vibe of this track, dealing with fears of entrapment, alongside those of lust and love. Another extremely promising step forward.",
