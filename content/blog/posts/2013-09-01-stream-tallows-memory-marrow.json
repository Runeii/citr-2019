  "body": "Nine months since they burst onto [these very pages](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/18393-introducing-tallows/), Oklahoma quartet **Tallows** have released their fantastic debut LP. **_Memory Marrow_** is an unrelenting listen, tearing through a score of musical influences, from the likes of **Vampire Weekend** to fellow Okie’s **Kings of Leon**, with a touch of **Death Cab for Cutie** added for good measure, it’s no frills attached, brilliant songwriting. Having had it on repeat over the past month or so, I can wholeheartedly say that it’s one of my favourite records of 2013 thus far. Check out **_Memory Marrow_** in full below, including my personal favourite, _Mothball_, and download it from their [Bandcamp](http://tallowsmusic.bandcamp.com/).",
