  "body": "London duo **[Pandr Eyez](http://soundcloud.com/pandreyez)** are an odd project. Two kids, one from the USA (Ferren) and the other a Brit (Tom), they combine to create a glistening and smooth style of Rn’B that sours and smothers in the most gratifying of ways. It all sounds rather perfect, the influences are delicately and sweetly overlaid over grooves that pop and shudder with an impeccable amount of confidence.\n\nThe band have only played live once and so far all we have to go on is a 3 track EP they put out a couple of months ago; for now at least, it’s all I need.\n\nStream the EP below, and cheers to [**Rebel Magazine**](http://www.wearerebels.com/2011/07/08/interview-pandr-eyez/) for the heads up.\n\n [Pandr Eyez](http://soundcloud.com/pandreyez/sets/pandr-eyez-2) by [PANDR EYEZ](http://soundcloud.com/pandreyez)",
