  "body": "You may remember a few weeks back we posted a [beautiful track](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/11761-mpfree-i-come-to-shanghai-in-your-own-way/) from dream-pop duo **I Come To Shanghai**, well I’m delighted to be able to bring you this exclusive mix put together by the pair, showcasing just a smidgen of their eclectic tastes. Whilst listening back to this mix, entitled **_No Drugs_**, I began to realise that it’s entirely unclassifiable; swinging between more straight forward electro-pop to classical European tracks and right back to slick R’n’B. Anyway, it’s truly worth a listen, check out _**No Drugs**_ below, and head over to the official [I Come To Shanghai](icometoshanghai.com) website to grab their debut sophomore release _**Eternal Life Vol. 1**_.\n\nArtwork by our friends at [Fig and Fox](http://www.facebook.com/figandfox).\n\n[I Come To Shanghai – No Drugs (CitR Mix #14)](http://www.mixcloud.com/joshmaxdalton/i-come-to-shanghai-no-drugs-citr-mix-14/#utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=resource_link) by [Josh Dalton](http://www.mixcloud.com/joshmaxdalton/#utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=profile_link) on [Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com/#utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=homepage_link)",
