  "body": "RAINER performed at Sebright Arms to toast the launch of their impressive EP–Hope/Satin/Glass/Dreams.\n\nVocalist Rebekah Raa took the stage in a floor-length black sequined dress and barefeet. (A nice touch) The duo treated the audience to a new track, Water, that I’m very much looking forward to hearing soon. On film Rebekah gives off some very serious Roisin Murphy vibes. All the way down to the dancing.\n\n#gallery-1 { margin: auto; } #gallery-1 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } #gallery-1 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-1 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } /\\* see gallery\\_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php \\*/\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_2305-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/uncategorized/25054-snapshots-rainer-live-sebright-arms-28th-nov/attachment/img_2305)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_2328-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/uncategorized/25054-snapshots-rainer-live-sebright-arms-28th-nov/attachment/img_2328)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_2349-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/uncategorized/25054-snapshots-rainer-live-sebright-arms-28th-nov/attachment/img_2349-2)\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_2358-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/uncategorized/25054-snapshots-rainer-live-sebright-arms-28th-nov/attachment/img_2358)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_2367-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/uncategorized/25054-snapshots-rainer-live-sebright-arms-28th-nov/attachment/img_2367)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_2380-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/uncategorized/25054-snapshots-rainer-live-sebright-arms-28th-nov/attachment/img_2380)\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_2388-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/uncategorized/25054-snapshots-rainer-live-sebright-arms-28th-nov/attachment/img_2388)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_2391-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/uncategorized/25054-snapshots-rainer-live-sebright-arms-28th-nov/attachment/img_2391)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_2410-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/uncategorized/25054-snapshots-rainer-live-sebright-arms-28th-nov/attachment/img_2410)\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_2422-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/uncategorized/25054-snapshots-rainer-live-sebright-arms-28th-nov/attachment/img_2422)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_2453-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/uncategorized/25054-snapshots-rainer-live-sebright-arms-28th-nov/attachment/img_2453)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_2325-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/uncategorized/25054-snapshots-rainer-live-sebright-arms-28th-nov/attachment/img_2325)\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_2395-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/uncategorized/25054-snapshots-rainer-live-sebright-arms-28th-nov/attachment/img_2395)",
