  "body": "Saint Louis’s **Bad Bandit** aka Chase Oros, has seemingly appeared from nowhere with this fantastic debut EP release.\n\nWhilst Oros has a [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/chaseo) that’s littered with rough demos and covers, his new EP, Conifers takes his music to an entirely different level altogether. Mixing elements of **S O H N’s** luxurious, beat-orientated ‘sadcore’ and the dreaded ‘chillwave’, it’s a stunningly reassured release. Opening with the vocal loop of _Ghosts_, that slips effortlessly into a six minute epic, it’s a beautiful EP, thoroughly deserving of the praise that will undoubtedly be thrown it’s way. Check out Conifer below, including my personal favourite, Okay.",
