  "body": "I’m not entirely sure how to describe the music of **Delphic Oracle**.\n\nSort of sounding like London Grammar transported through the set of a 70’s horror flick, and I mean a properly scary one, I’m kind of creeped out. Take the a cappella track, _Death Dreams_, driven solely by the spine tingling vocals of **Christiana Key**; it’s both harrowing and utterly beautiful at the same time. The other track available so far, _Watching the Fern_, is equally as sinister, with Key’s foreboding vocals providing little room for glimpses of light to shine through, paired with shrieking violins. Don’t get me wrong, for as nightmarish as it is, it’s also brilliant, and an extremely promising indicator of what’s to come on the full EP, out 4 September.",
