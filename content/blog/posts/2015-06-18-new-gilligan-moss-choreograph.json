  "body": "You may have already come across Gilligan Moss in the form of one of his many brilliant remixes, with highlights including a remix of Glass Animals’ ‘Gooey’ and Sia’s ‘Big Girls Cry’.\n\nHis glitchy, shimmering production style makes an immediate impression, and after a period of experimentation Gilligan has announced the release of his debut EP, ‘Ceremonial’, through exciting new UK label AMF Records.\n\nThe first track from the EP is ‘Choreograph’, and while a few keen Gilligan Moss fans may already recognise the track, it has now been remastered into a whole new glory, and you can check it out below.",
