  "body": "The Oxford (Mississippi) based collective, **[Cats Purring](http://www.facebook.com/catspurring)**, are a group of artists that I’m becoming increasingly obsessed with. Nothing, I repeat nothing, they’ve released so far, (at least the jams I’ve heard), have even come close to disappointing. This track came along and my worst fears have been realised; I am in love, and it’s likely to remain a love unrequited. For now I’m blaming it on geographical reasons, they’re in Mississippi, I’m in London; it would never work.\n\nThe track in question was made by **[Tommy Toussaint](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Tommy-Toussaint/141591589227131)**, one part of **[Dent May](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/10227-new-dent-may-wedding-day/ \"New: Dent May – Wedding Day\")**, the leader of the pack if you will. It’s a blisteringly carefree jam; reserved, classic, simple, call it what you will. Whatever you call it, it’s a wonderfully catchy end of summer tune.\n\nPerfect pop.\n\n [Tommy Toussaint – Summer USA](http://soundcloud.com/makeminerecords/tommy-toussaint-summer-usa) by [make-mine](http://soundcloud.com/makeminerecords)",
