  "body": "So this is a little bit special.\n\n**Eric En**, a Montreal based singer/songwriter aided by his cousin **Huy Nguyen** on production duties, has crafted one of the most alluring pieces of music I’ve heard this year thus far. Whilst **Eric’s** [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/eric_n) is slightly haphazard in nature, overflowing with snippets and ideas (scribbles as he affectionately calls them), all showcasing potential yet none quite achieve the sheer beauty of this new track. A no strings attached piano ballad, _Moon I_ is fragile, tender and an intimately rewarding listen, echoing the likes of **Gem Club** and more ‘commercial’ **James Blake**. I’m overflowing with excitement. Check out the gorgeous _Moon I_ below and keep up with **Eric** via [his blog](http://recordtherecord.tumblr.com/page/2).",
