  "body": "**CITR**’s first encounter with [**Abstract Cannon**’s](http://abstractcannon.bandcamp.com/) work was his EP, [_Primary Consumer_](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/9083-introducing-abstract-cannon/ \"Introducing: Abstract Cannon\"), an apocalyptic and brooding slice of hip-hop. Since then the guy has been hard at work producing new material. His new single_, Swastika_, features up and coming MC **[Danny Watts](http://www.facebook.com/DannyWattsMusic)** and words from **Cannon** himself.\n\nThe sound itself has taken a remarkable new direction, perhaps because of the introduction of **Cannon** as a rapper in his own right. His voice is deep and commanding and clashes interestingly with the fluid and hazy beat. In truth his verse is a tad raw at times, it seems to flail hoping to land a punch, yet there’s a charming frankness to the subject matter and his empowered way of rapping that ultimately gives the record a sense of power.\n\nStream and download the single below.",
