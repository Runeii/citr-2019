Feel free to head to the [frontpage](www.crackintheroad.com) and have a little look around, we’d love some feedback, either over on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/crackintheroad) or [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/crackintheroad).\n\nAnyway, in the reshuffle, we lost several posts, as well as much of yesterday, so we’re playing catch-up a little. With that in mind here’s a bunch of tracks, some reposts, that we think are essential listening.",
