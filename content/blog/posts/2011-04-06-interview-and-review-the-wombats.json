The gig itself was obviously not to everybody’s taste, but for the people who appreciate the band and the music they play it was a superb performance. They were as energetic as ever and managed to play new songs such as _Anti-D and Jump into the Fog_ with as much precision as their, now, classic songs _Moving to New York_ and _Let’s Dance to Joy Division_ which for a fan was very pleasing. Any sign of their long break between albums was not on show as they played a large number of songs from their new album _This Modern Glitch_ which is due for release later this month. These new songs, in my opinion, are a vast change from their early songs and even from the likes of _My Circuitboard City_ which is most certainly a positive thing after considerable failures from other bands of a similar ilk releasing new albums that are repetitive and lacking in imagination. _Anti-D_ was performed in such an emotive way, with the crowd being taken on a journey through the pitfalls of prescription drugs and it was this song that was the highlight of the night and a cracking single as well. CitR were lucky enough to chat at considerable length to the guys before their gig and this is a section of the interview that was conducted:\n\n CitR: Which bands or artists would you say influenced you the most when you were younger?\n\n**Tord: A lot of things really; bands like Kraftwerk to No FX and a lot of Skate punk and alternative bands like that.**\n\n**Dan: I liked the same sort of stuff really, but also bands like System of a Down, Metallica and Blink 182.**\n\nCitR: If you were not involved in the music industry, what do you think you would be doing?\n\n**Dan: I would probably be teaching music in a French school**\n\n**Tord: I really love working with people so I would probably be working in a home for disabled people like I used to do.**\n\nCitR: What is the best show or festival you have ever played at?\n\n**There is no particular show that I would say stands above the rest but festivals such as Glastonbury and other European Festivals are always fantastic to play at. We also played on a Berlin rooftop a few weeks ago, it was freezing cold but it was an amazing experience!**\n\nCitR: What would you say to any bands or artists that want to get the same success as you achieved?\n\n**You have to enjoy what you have and don’t plan ahead, focus on what is important and that is playing music. Do little gigs in front of a couple of people and enjoy it for what it is.**\n\nCitR: Can you go into detail about how you achieved the Bleeding Love cover you recorded a couple of years ago?\n\n**Dan: It was me and Murph who did the song together as Tord was back in Norway on holiday and we were in Paris seeing some friend and just drank 3 bottles of French wine between us and just went for it.**\n\nCitR: What was the best band you have supported and been supported by?\n\n**Well we played just before Radiohead came on at a festival so that could mean we supported them I suppose, and that was unbelievable! The best band who have supported us were probably goFASTER>>** (a band we chatted to earlier in the day about) **or Team Me who are on tour with us this time around.**\n\nCitR: What was your most embarrassing moment on stage?\n\n**We did a DJ set in Harrowgate a while ago in a school and we hadn’t slept in ages and when we turned up there were people at the front as if it was a gig or something which was really odd. The CDs didn’t work so I just got really embarrassed and hid underneath the DJ booth.**\n\nCitR: If you could have any superpower what would it be?\n\n**Dan: Invisibility**\n\n**Tord: To Fly**\n\nCitR: What are your favourite drinks?\n\n**Tord: Fresh juice from a juice extractor or a Mojito if it was an alcoholic choice**\n\n**Dan: Guava juice and alcoholic drink would be Guinness.**\n\n The Wombats official site [here](www.thewombats.co.uk)\n\nThe Wombats Myspace [here](www.myspace.com/thewombatsuk)\n\nThe Wombats Facebook [here](http://www.facebook.com/?ref=home#!/thewombatsuk)",
