Featuring one of the tightest choruses of the year, and a killer video to go with it, it marked him out as a talent to keep an eye on.\n\nWith two releases last year – a one-off single and an extended EP, he’s returned with his first offering of 2016, in the form of the Silence of the Lambs inspired new single, _Clarice_. Drawing from a range of R&B and soul influences, alongside more straight up pop vibes, as well as calling in saxophonist Jaedon Alvira; it’s an engrossing and addictive listen. I doubt there’s been a more fitting ode to Jodie Foster; check it out below, alongside a short Q&A with Quake.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.\n\nWhilst your music covers a pretty broad range of genres, there seems to be a fairly strong pop core in the songwriting – influence wise, where do you think this stems from?\n\n_probably stems from my love of pop music haha. I try to keep it at a balance though between pop and other stuff that I like, while making sure it says raw and true to me. _\n\nHow does the creative process tend to play out for you when writing music?\n\n_Im always producing stuff all the time so I have a lot of instrumentals lying around. but when it comes to writing lyrics it’s a tougher process for me. Music comes out honest no matter what because it’s ethereal. but words will trip you up. when I have to try and verbalize all my feelings and emotions into something cohesive, its more difficult. _\n\nClarice features a saxophone solo from Jaedon Alvira; how did this come about?\n\n_one day I realized that I needed more saxophone in my music. the saxophone has a smooth and sexual energy that I like. Jaedon is a friend of mine that I met at music school so I hit him up to see if he was down to play on the track. The next week we chilled and he layed down the part in his living room. _\n\nThere’s a strong visual element behind your releases; just how important is this to you, and how crucial is the online platform with regard to expressing this extra artistic element?\n\n_I like expressing myself in different mediums and collaborating with people so it’s chill.  but sometimes it would be nice to not have to think about all that stuff. As a musician these days, you have a lot of social media to maintain. people expect you to be just as good in every different type of media as you are in music. that’s a lot to live up to but I just try to have fun with it and make shit that I would wana experie_nce.\n\nWhat does the future have in store for Richie Quake?\n\n_probably some interesting stuff that I can’t even predict. but mostly more music, more videos, an album when I’m ready. I’m just gonna keep doin my thing and whatever happens, happens. _",
