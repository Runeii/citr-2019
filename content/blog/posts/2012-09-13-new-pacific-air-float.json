  "body": "Following a growing trend of ‘blogbuzz’ acts, pop duo **KO KO**, whom we [introduced](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/15567-introducing-ko-ko/) to the world back in March of this year alongside their gorgeous debut three track EP, have signed to Universal Records for their debut single and (presumably) the release of their first LP. Having also gained plaudits from our friends at [Disco Naviete](http://disconaivete.com/post/20956778799) and [The Recommender](http://therecommender.net/2012/03/24/ko-ko/), it doesn’t really come as a surprise that such a respected label have taken a chance on Ryan and Taylor, two brothers from San Diego. Having now changed their name to Pacific Air, reportedly due to legal reasons, the duo are readying the release of their debut single, as well as touring with **Passion Pit**.\n\n_Float_ is a rerecording of the aforementioned EP’s standout track, with Chis Zane on production duties and is out now on [iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/float-single/id561845607). It may be several months on from the first time we heard the track, but it’s still as delightfully upbeat as I remember, and is sure to only bolster their reputation as one of the hottest new acts around.",
