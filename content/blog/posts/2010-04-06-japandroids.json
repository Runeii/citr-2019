  "date": "2010-04-06T11:45:00",
  "body": "If like me, Post-Nothing was one of your albums of 2009, then you are sure to welcome back the return of Canadian rockers Japandroids.\n\nArt Czars is the new single released as a taster for the upcoming album, which is expected to drop around the end of 2010. Also to look forward to for Japandroids fans is the release of No Singles, a collection of all their previous songs not featured on last years Post-Nothing. (Art Czars will not feature on the compilation).\n\nArt Czars begins frantically, with stop start drums and guitar opening the track, before they get back into a similar rhythm experienced on last years album. The raw guitar sound is perfect backing for their emotional lyrics, which tell the story of a breakdown in a relationship, in which the singer recalls “here’s your money back, here’s your punk rock back“. Art Czarsis a fantastic indication of the potential that this band have, and hopefully will act as a stepping stone for greater work.\n\n[Official Website](http://japandroids.com/)  \n[Download Art Czars](http://www.mediafire.com/?tljmwzjull0)",
