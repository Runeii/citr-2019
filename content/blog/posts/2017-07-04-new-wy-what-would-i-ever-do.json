  "date": "2017-07-04T11:20:09",
  "body": "Absolutely adore Bathrooms, the first track I heard from Swedish duo **Wy** released earlier this year, and their second offering doesn’t disappoint either.\n\nAnother intricately composed number, there’s elements of radio ready pop songwriting, merged with a more elegant, Beach House tinged vibe, all wrapped up with a healthy dose of nostalgia. Check out _What Would I Ever Do_ below, alongside the accompanying video.",
