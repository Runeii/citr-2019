  "body": "Though many may not have heard of him, **Federico Grazzini** is a name you should certainly remember.\n\n Having played in clubs around the globe from London to Tokyo, and an active resident member of **The Zoo Project**, **Federico Grazzini** has mastered a sound that incorporates the best of electro and house in a cool minimalist style. His performance recently at **Sankeys** club in Manchester, a club recently announced Number 1 in Europe by DJ Magazine, was mind blowing. **Federico** constantly engaged with the crowd, appearing to tailor each track to the reaction he gained from a dance floor that was never still. **Crack In The Road** were lucky enough to have a short interview with **Federico** at 4:30am shortly after he had finished his set!\n\n_CITR:_ What music do you listen to when you’re not recording?\n\n**I listen to lots of old funk, like Stevie Wonder. I spend so much time in the studio, something like 10 hours per day! So when I go out I just want to change my panorama.**\n\n_CITR:_ What was your favourite clubbing experience as a DJ?\n\n**The club I really like is here, both in 2009 and 2010! During the summer it would definitely be Zoo Project, because it is my home in Ibiza and it is a different concept of a club. During the day you can go for a swim in the swimming pool, and go to different arenas to dance to different types of music. However in the winter I enjoy Tenax, where I am resident, and Womb club in Tokyo is really really good also.**\n\n_CITR:_ What has been your experience of playing in England of late? What do you think of Sankeys?\n\n**I’ve played three times this year, one time in Egg, one time T Bar and obviously tonight! Sankeys is one of the best clubs I’ve ever seen. I love underground clubs, and this one especially. It is really really good to play on this dance floor as you can play what ever you want and the crowd will always love it. I have had so much fun tonight.**\n\n[Check out Federico Grazzini’s Myspace!](http://www.myspace.com/federicograzzini)",
