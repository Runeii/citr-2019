  "body": "Does this guy ever stop? **Jamison** aka **Teen Daze** is undoubtedly one of the hardest working musicians around.\n\nWith a [**Two Bicycles**](http://twobicyclesband.bandcamp.com/) release under his belt earlier this year, and his label [Cultus Vibes](http://www.cultusvibes.com/) going from strength to strength, he’s also graced us with a fresh new track from his premier outfit **Teen Daze**. _Winter Sun_ (premiered on [The Fader](http://www.thefader.com/2011/11/11/teen-daze-winter-sun-mp3/) earlier tonight) is an electro-instrumental effort, conjuring up images of idyllic summer months gone by. As a stand-alone piece of music, it almost feels like it should be bridging the gap between two out-and-out anthems. Check out _Winter Sun_ below, which will feature on a new **Cultus Vibes** compilation entitled _**Together**_, out 6 December and featuring the likes of **Bank Heist**, **Parish Of Little Clifton**, **Manitoulin** and **Des A Boda**.\n\n[Teen Daze, “Winter Sun”](http://soundcloud.com/fadermedia/teen-daze-winter-sun) by [The FADER](http://soundcloud.com/fadermedia)",
