  "body": "Philadelphia duo [**Work Drugs**](http://www.facebook.com/workdrugs) are some of the hardest working guys around, constantly churning out top quality, insanely danceable tracks. New single _Blue Steel_ is no exception, with plenty of 80’s pop inspiration dominating the track, even featuring a _Video Killed The Radio Star_ breakdown halfway through. The video is comprised solely of clips from 1987 rom-com **Mannequin**; so it’s no surprise to learn that there’s an abundance of flirtatious dancing and slightly questionable, dated moves. Check out the video below and head over to **Work Drugs** [bandcamp](http://workdrugs.bandcamp.com/) to grab their new album **_Aurora Lies_**, out November 7.",
