  "body": "Alongside announcing a UK tour for May and EU support slots with The Naked and Famous, NZ duo **Black City Lights** have just dropped an otherworldly remix of label-mates Shocking Pinks.\n\nMaking the track even darker, and more foreboding than the original, it’s a real late night listen, that wouldn’t be out of place in the most progressive London clubs. With slots at The Great Escape and Bristol’s Start The Bus on the horizon, as well as new material expected later in the year, Black City Lights are raring to go for what is sure to be an impressive year. Check out their remix of _Gun Nest / Not Gambling_ below, alongside the original, and be sure to catch them on tour over the next couple of months (dates below).\n\n[![1913300_641954222551814_687255644842606539_o](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/1913300_641954222551814_687255644842606539_o.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/1913300_641954222551814_687255644842606539_o.jpg)",
