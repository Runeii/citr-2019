Some of you may remember that last month, **Mos Def** (now calling himself **Yasiin Bey**) and **Talib Kweli** came back with new **Black Star** material with production from _the_ purest of geniuses **Madlib**, debuting it live on US late-night chat show The Colbert Report (with help from **J Rocc**).\n\nWell now that tune, which went down well with fans, has been studio recorded for your pleasure – **Dizzee Rascal** would be chuffed (I assume they were quoting him here). You can stream it below, soulful backing track included – it should tease what the new album will sound like. I’m thinking the vocals might need to be mixed into the track a little, but for now this is looking great; this is the raw deal. Anybody else psyched for their comeback? I know I bloody am.\n\n_You can stream Fix Up below, and purchase it via iTunes [here](http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/fix-up-single-single/id483271718)._",
