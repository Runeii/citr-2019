  "body": "Since **Sunless ’97**s emergence with their split single, _Body Weather/Azul_, in June of last year, the band have retired into relative obscurity.\n\nThey’re set to return this month with a new split single, due out on Not Even Music. The a-side, _Aurora I_, is the first cut released for stream. Increasingly catchy on repeated listens, it’s not the best piece of work the band have put out, but it has a timeless groove that’s difficult not to at least twitch to.\n\nThe band will celebrate the record’s release [**at the Sebright Arms**](https://www.facebook.com/events/113956742118529/) on the 20th of March.",
