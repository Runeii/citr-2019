Recent cut _Hypnotized_ sounds like it’s been lifted from Random Access Memories, and I mean that in the most positive way possible.\n\nWith seven tracks on his Soundcloud, with plays barely breaking the one thousand marker, it’s criminal that **Retro Culture** is so underrated. So it’s far from the most complex set of compositions you’ll hear this year, but for what it is, it’s sheer brilliance. Check out a couple more tracks of **Retro Culture’s** below, and grab the rest over at his [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/retroculture).",
