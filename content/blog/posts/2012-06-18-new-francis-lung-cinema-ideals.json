  "date": "2012-06-18T14:20:34",
  "body": "**Francis Lung** aka Tom McLung (**WU LYF** bassist) has been quiet for a while now, no doubt penning new tunes and readying his debut solo record, expected later this year.\n\nWith _Cinema Ideals_, his first new material in well over half a year, he takes you on a journey back to the late 60’s, picture a shabby downtown bar and a harmonica wielding troubadour hunched over a bar stool, lamenting his lost loves and you begin to understand where Francis Lung draws inspiration from. There’s more than a touch of **Dylan** and possibly even a scent of **WU LYF** favourite **Robbie Basho**, all in all, a distinctively beautiful track.",
