  "date": "2015-05-12T17:03:39",
  "body": "Lisbon quartet **Vaarwell** may well be the first Portugal based act I’ve featured on this site in five years; and their beautiful debut EP, **_Love and Forgiveness_**, is easily worthy of the praise that will undoubtedly come their way.\n\nCentred around the ‘lead’ single, Branches, there’s elements of London Grammar and Daughter in the delicate, fragile nature of Margarida Falcao’s sublime vocals. Early days, and the production clearly isn’t as slick / big budget as the aforementioned artists, but there’s definitely enough here to suggest immense potential. Check out EP highlights, Branches and Won’t Let Go below, and grab the full release on [Bandcamp](http://vaarwell.bandcamp.com/album/love-and-forgiveness).\n\n<a href=\"http://vaarwell.bandcamp.com/album/love-and-forgiveness\">Love and Forgiveness by Vaarwell</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://vaarwell.bandcamp.com/album/love-and-forgiveness\">Love and Forgiveness by Vaarwell</a>",
