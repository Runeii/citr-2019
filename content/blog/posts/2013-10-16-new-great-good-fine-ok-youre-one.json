  "date": "2013-10-16T00:00:37",
  "body": "It’s been an awesome year for pop music, and by that I don’t mean your likes of Gaga, Katy Perry or Ms.\n\nCyrus. I’m talking Lorde and The 1975, alongside huge singles from London Grammar, and my personal pop single of the year, Panama Wedding’s All Of The People. Another track set to stamp its name alongside the aforementioned jams is **Great Good Fine Ok’s** debut single, _You’re The One For Me_, a slick, R&B joint, fusing the smooth verses with one of the most uplifting choruses of the year. Check it out below, and keep up with GGFO on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/GreatGoodFineOk), oh and there’s a remix from Body Language thrown in for good measure.",
