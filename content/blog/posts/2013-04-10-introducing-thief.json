  "body": "The UK is in the middle of a synth-pop revival, with male/female duo’s seemingly dominating blogs, and independent charts.\n\nWith almost every act drawing comparisons to **Purity Ring** and/or **Blue Hawaii**, perhaps it’s time that the UK has their very own combo leading the way, and London’s **THIEF** could perhaps be the ones to claim the territory. With their combo of debut tracks, _Friend/Lover_ and _Satine Repeat_ before released earlier today, their sound is slick, reassuring simplistic yet wonderfully effective. Satine Repeat touches on deep-house elements, whilst Friend/Lover could well be the track to shot them to blog fame. Check out both below.\n\n“_don’t wanna be your friend / I wanna be your lover_”",
