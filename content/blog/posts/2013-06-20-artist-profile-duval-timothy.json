  "body": "From the stand out primary colour scheme with stunning blues, reds and yellows to even Duval himself, often sporting his signature handmade bow ties, his ‘uniform’ if you will, this London based artist plays what it means to recognise and associate.\n\nAlong with music and language, Duval plays with our ties to cultural identity but through a global branding and advertising path. Theres that purple on a Cadburys wrapper, that blue which greets us on Facebook. Sooner or later there’ll be that colour that will immediately signal a ‘Duval Timothy’ a mile away. I’m looking forward to it.\n\nFor Duval’s website click [HERE](http://officialduvaltimothy.tumblr.com/). Examples of his work are below\n\nDuval also co directs THE GROUNDNUT along with friends Folayemi Brown and Jacob Todd. A part-time restaurant and food project. The food served draws inspiration from their collective heritage from: England, Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone & South-Sudan.\n\nFor more information and to buy tickets click [HERE](http://www.thegroundnut.co.uk/THE_GROUNDNUT/HOME.html).\n\n#gallery-1 { margin: auto; } #gallery-1 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } #gallery-1 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-1 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } /\\* see gallery\\_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php \\*/\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/A-uniform-for-my-People-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22626-artist-profile-duval-timothy/attachment/a-uniform-for-my-people)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-20-at-14.47.19-150x150.png)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22626-artist-profile-duval-timothy/attachment/screen-shot-2013-06-20-at-14-47-19)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Arsenal-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22626-artist-profile-duval-timothy/attachment/arsenal)\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Bow-tie-for-Corbusier-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22626-artist-profile-duval-timothy/attachment/bow-tie-for-corbusier)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Bow-Tie-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22626-artist-profile-duval-timothy/attachment/bow-tie)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/EULB-HGUOROB-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22626-artist-profile-duval-timothy/attachment/eulb-hguorob)\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/I-know-we-are-but-what-am-I-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22626-artist-profile-duval-timothy/attachment/i-know-we-are-but-what-am-i)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Jacob-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22626-artist-profile-duval-timothy/attachment/jacob)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Traum-Bow-Ties-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22626-artist-profile-duval-timothy/attachment/traum-bow-ties)",
