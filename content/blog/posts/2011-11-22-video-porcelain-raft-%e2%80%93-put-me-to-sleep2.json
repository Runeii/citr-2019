The set, for want of a better phrase, was ‘fucking fantasic’, with **Mauro Remiddi** leaving the crowds’ jaws literally hanging in the now legendary London space.\n\nSince then, he’s been picked up by **Secretly Canadian**, has an album due out early next year and most importantly, he’s still making damagingly emotionally music. His new video sees Remiddi drowning in a bath of milk. It’s a humbling and uncomfortable watch.\n\n_Strange Weekend_ comes out through Secretly Canadian on January 24th.",
