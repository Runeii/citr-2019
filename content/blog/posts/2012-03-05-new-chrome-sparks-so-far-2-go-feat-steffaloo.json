Steffaloo)\")** that hasn’t already been said on the pages of CitR. The pair has become blog darlings in our eyes and rightly so, they make fantastic music. I’ve always thought they make pretty conflicting music as well, however rather than cancelling each other out, they form something both sedated and more frankly bass and beat focused.\n\nTheir new track, premiering on [Portals’ 3 Mixtape](http://www.portalsmusic.com/2012/03/sounds/portals-mixtape-3-sxsw-sampler/) today, is a prime example. **Steffaloo**’s soothing tones contrasting with **Sparks**’ cowbell focused beats.\n\nJust divine.",
