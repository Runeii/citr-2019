  "body": "Loved **Jens Kuross’s** Nobody Problem, which had a real 70’s vibe to it.\n\nHe’s now returned with another offering, in the form of the equally as poignant _Try To Follow_. The elegant vocals almost drift in and out, giving it an almost off-the-cuff feel, whilst the chorus could be lifted from Coldplay’s Parachutes; and I mean that in the best way possible (love that album). Check it out below.\n\nFollow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
