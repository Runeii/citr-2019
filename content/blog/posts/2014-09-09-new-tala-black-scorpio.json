  "date": "2014-09-09T12:05:08",
  "body": "**TALA** was already hands down one of my favourite new artists of 2014, and this new cut suggests that there’s plenty more to come from her.\n\nHer debut EP was an intoxicating mix of trippy electronic merged with more traditional yet twisted pop hooks, and _Black Scorpio_ shows no sign of her slipping up any time soon. As crazy as it sounds, there’s sections to this new track that immediately remind me of The Avalanches, or even DJ Shadow, not so much in the choppy beats, but more in the bold, experimental nature of the composition. Check out Black Scorpio below.",
