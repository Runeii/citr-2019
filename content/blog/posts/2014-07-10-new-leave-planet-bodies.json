  "body": "I’m a little late to this one, but boy am I glad I’ve found **Leave the Planet**.\n\n With only two tracks online, this London duo (Nathalia Bruno and Jack Milwaukee) create brooding and dark soundscapes with a hazy and washed out production that I can’t help but fall for. _Between Bodies_ is a startling good effort, the guitars perched subtly above the gritty electronic landscape below. It really is a mesmerising sound.\n\n(Thanks to [The Undscvrd](http://www.theundscvrd.com/new-artists/leave-the-planet/) for putting me onto these guys).",
