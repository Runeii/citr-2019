  "body": "It’s been a couple of months since we last heard from LA’s **The Distnce**; when I [first posted](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/10757-new-the-distnce-dry-land/) about him I couldn’t find out much/any information, however since then he’s revealed himself as **James Lucas**. Granted, one name isn’t much to go on, but it’s a start. With _After The War_, the third track from **The Distnce**, **Lucas** maintains the same ethereal, dream pop feel as experienced on debut track _Dry Land_. It’s simplistic but wonderfully wholesome and immaculately produced, with Lucas bemoaning ‘incase you’ve forgotten, why you always strike first, ‘cus it’s in your nature, to believe the words’ over the top of an organic percussion section. Whilst **The Distnce** is very much still in it’s infancy as a project, the three tracks so far are surefire signals of intent that **Lucas** is in it for the long run. Check out _After The War_ below, and head over to **The Distnce’s** [bandcamp](http://thedistnce.bandcamp.com/) for a pay-what-you-like download.\n\n<a href=\"http://thedistnce.bandcamp.com/track/after-the-war\">After the War by The Distnce</a>",
