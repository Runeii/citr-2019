  "body": "After announcing a set of almost instantly sold out small gigs and a cryptic teaser on their website earlier this week, **Foals** have been somewhat elusive of late.\n\nTheir silence has been broken by the release of _Inhaler_, the new single from their upcoming third album _**Holy Fire**_. This single marks a complete departure from the math rock mystique that the band still flirted with on second album _**Total Life Forever**_. The new album title is a fitting tribute to a track which acts as a truer representation of **Foals** live sound. It’s a sharp contrast between light and shade. Fragmented guitars juxtaposed with a towering chorus reminiscent of **Young Legionnaire**.\n\nFrom this it’s possible to deduce only one thing; we should forget everything we knew about **Foals**. It’s easy for a band to repeat a successful formula; to spew out verbatim time and again. Fortunately there are those who see this as anathema. The band you knew is dead. **_Antidotes_** is dead. **_Total Life Forever_** is dead. Foals are dead, long live Foals.",
