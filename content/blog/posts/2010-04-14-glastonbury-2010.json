  "body": "So a press release leaked earlier today has been confirmed by **Glastonbury** officials, revealing that **Snoop Dogg**, **MGMT** and **The Pet Shop Boys** are indeed to join this years line up.\n\nThey will perform alongside artists such as **Muse**, **U2**, **Stevie Wonde**r and **Scissor Sisterâ€™s**, again proving that when it comes down to it, **Glastonbur****y** really are excellent at pulling the big names out the bag. In a year when UK festivals seem to have relatively poor line ups compared to previous years, it is good to see **Michael Eavis** really pushing the boat out, especially in terms of the variety of artists featured. **Glastonbury** takes place between 25th-27th June, and is already completely sold out. We want to hear from you if you are going, what do you think of the line up?\n\nThe full line up can be found [here.](http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/)",
