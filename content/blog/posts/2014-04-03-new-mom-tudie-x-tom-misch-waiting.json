  "date": "2014-04-03T14:00:12",
  "body": "Talk about two birds, one stone.\n\nWe’ve featured Mom Tudie on Crack in the Road before, however it’s been a long time coming for 18 year old Londoner Tom Misch to make his way onto the pages of our fair blog.\n\nTwo insanely talented musicians/producers, Mom Tudie and Tom Misch joining forces has led to the creation of ‘Waiting On You’, a track that is coated in a Balearic feel and is a guaranteed repeat listen. An enticing vocal line is underpinned by a gorgeous bass line, both of which fluctuate in speed and intensity in a manner similar to the gentle lapping of waves against an Iberian shore.\n\nThere is no doubt these are two artists to keep your eye on in 2014.",
