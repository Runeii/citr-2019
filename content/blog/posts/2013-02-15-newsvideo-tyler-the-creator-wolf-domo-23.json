While I was unplugged from DAS INTERWEBZ last night, Odd Future leader Tyler, The Creator not only announced details regarding his new album, _Wolf_, but also dropped the video for the lead single from the album, ‘Domo 23’.\n\nThe video continues where OFWGKTA’s \\[adult swim\\] show Loiter Squad left off and revolves around a wrestling match against Domo Genesis, with Earl Sweatshirt acting as the referee. If you’re not a fan of Odd Future’s aesthetic and sound, then ‘Domo 23’ is not going to change your opinion in the slightest, although I seriously doubt that’s what Tyler was aiming for. The video is irreverently amusing and appears to be a homage to, rather than a satire of, professional wrestling.The song itself is a typical Tyler affair; high energy, stabbing synths with the chromatic scales the group loves, shuffling drums and provocative lyrics delivered in Tyler’s trademark growl, all of which is highly enjoyable.\n\nThe barsmith (this is going to be a ‘thing’ now) and beatmaker also released details regarding _Wolf. _Currently, the album is set to be dropped on the 2nd April and can be preordered on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/wolf/id600946351). Probably my favourite thing about the announcement though are the three album covers Tyler has prepared for _Wolf_, which are shown below. The first of these actually gave me 4reel LULZ, which means that I need it on vinyl. Tyler also has a solitary UK show in London on the 30th March, with the venue TBA at the time of writing.\n\n[![tyler-wolf1](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tyler-wolf1-260x260.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/19803-newsvideo-tyler-the-creator-wolf-domo-23/attachment/tyler-wolf1/)\n\n[![tyler_wolfcover1](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tyler_wolfcover1-260x260.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/19803-newsvideo-tyler-the-creator-wolf-domo-23/attachment/tyler_wolfcover1/)\n\n[![tyler-wolf-cover2](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tyler-wolf-cover2-260x260.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/19803-newsvideo-tyler-the-creator-wolf-domo-23/attachment/tyler-wolf-cover2/)",
