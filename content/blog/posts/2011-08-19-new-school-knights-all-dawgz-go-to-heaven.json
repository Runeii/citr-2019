  "body": "The music of [**School Knights**](http://www.facebook.com/pages/School-Knights/144671538891580) comes at you like a cascade of testosterone and sweat. 4 bros making music because they can; with little thought towards the result of the music. I mean this in the most sincere and respectful way possible. The music School Knight’s make is fun, and gloriously so.\n\nTheir new record, **_All Dawgz Go To Heaven_**, catches the summer right at its close, and perhaps coincidently, it mirrors the feeling of the time. The sound feels like a crash of temperatures and moods, combining surf-pop with the more gritty aspects of punk and trash, the result is something that’s odd to the ear but ultimately playful. Think **Fang Island** on a surf board.\n\nStream the album below.\n\n [School Knights – All Dawgz Go To Heaven](http://soundcloud.com/draculahorse/sets/school-knights-all-dawgz-go-to) by [DRACULA HORSE](http://soundcloud.com/draculahorse)",
