  "body": "Artwork by **[Michela Heim](http://www.flickr.com/photos/motionslow/)**\n\nAs much as I claim/insist I’m a fountain of knowledge when it comes to contemporary music, there’s always going to be an artist that makes it literally impossible to know any more than, ‘This track’s pretty dope’. And this track is indeed, ‘pretty dope’, yet it leaves a painfully unsatisfied taste in the mouth; the taste of wanting more. Meeting somewhere in the middle of house and post-dubstep, [**Placeholder**’s](http://soundcloud.com/pplaceholderr) latest cut is a jerking and bubbling delight; simple synths, a great arrangement of samples and a killer groove, sometimes that’s all you need.\n\nStream the new track below and check out more of his/her stuff on [soundcloud.](http://soundcloud.com/pplaceholderr)\n\nStream Placeholder’s last cut – Don’t U Know",
