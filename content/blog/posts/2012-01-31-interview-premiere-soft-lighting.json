  "body": "With his debut track _Far Away_ gracing the internet little over two weeks ago, Kansas City’s **Soft Lighting**, the side-project of **Bryan Cox** (also of **[New Savages](http://newsavages.bandcamp.com/)**) is beginning to forge a name for himself. Having been [Introduced](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13822-introducing-soft-lighting/) by myself a fortnight ago, _Far Away_ also appeared on acclaimed music blog **[Lost Lost Lost](http://www.lostlostlost.com/2012/01/soft-lighting-far-away.html)** on Saturday**,** as well as featuring on several other prominent music websites.\n\nWhilst his music may have created a stir, there’s little information available on **Bryan Cox**, so we jumped at the opportunity to get a few questions answered. Bryan also gave us the exclusive first play of the new **Soft Lighting** track; the gloriously upbeat _Forever_. Reverb-heavy vocals and languid synths transform this track into a brilliantly vibrant, chillwave inspired number, perfectly fitted to the trippy, cartoon filled video. Check out our short interview below, as well as the premiere of _Forever_.\n\n_Crack in the Road: How did Soft Lighting come about, and is it a solo venture, or are there others involved?_\n\n**It’s my solo work. It kinda came about in between other projects. I was busy with the band I’m in, New Savages and helping produce local music etc. Every once in a while I would have a break and work on a song that was kinda just for myself. After a while I realized I had about an album worth of material so I figured I ought to give it a name and put it out there.**\n\n_CitR: The influences on your debut track Far Away seem quite prominent, with ‘chillwave’ being a word used quite a bit. What would you describe as the main influences behind Soft Lighting, musically and otherwise?_\n\n**Since the songs were recorded over the course of a few years, there is actually a pretty diverse range of influences. Everything from Italo Disco and 80s film soundtracks to newer stuff like Teeel, Casa del Mirto and Washed Out. Anything with a groove really. I also really like all the [Beer On The Rug](http://www.beerontherug.com/) releases because they’re this funny 80s/90s kitsch thing but really experimental and strung out at the same time.**\n\n_CitR: What are your plans for Soft Lighting over the coming months?_\n\n**I’m super excited because it looks like [Synthemesc Recordings](http://synthemesc-recordings.com/) is going to release the album. The entire album will be available digitally soon. I’m also collaborating with an awesome artist, [Anna Spence](http://anna-spence.com/) on a series of videos for each song. So we will put those out as we finish them.**\n\n[Soft Lighting – Forever](http://vimeo.com/35969230) from [Soft Lighting](http://vimeo.com/user10187316) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).\n\n_CitR: Were you surprised at the hugely positive reaction to your debut track?_\n\n**Yes definitely. It’s funny because I actually had initially only put up the demo version of Far Away just to be able to create the bandcamp and start playing around with the design and stuff. I didn’t even intend to “release” it or anything yet, but somehow someone found it and because of word of mouth and awesome blogs like Crack In The Road, its caught on.**\n\n_CitR: How much do you think your surroundings have affected your sound?_\n\n**There’s not much of an electronic scene in Kansas City. Or maybe there is and I’m just not cool enough to know about it haha. I guess I just surround myself with a few really good friends that are either artists or art lovers. They are my inspiration.**\n\n_CitR: And finally… if you could have any super power, what would it be?_\n\n**Super sonic hearing**.",
