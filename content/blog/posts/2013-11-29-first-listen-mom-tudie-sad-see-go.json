  "date": "2013-11-29T18:38:24",
  "body": "It’s Friday, and while you might be gearing up for a raucous weekend, we have the first listen on a beautiful slow jam by the exciting young producer Mom Tudie.\n\nFeaturing the vocals of the supremely talented Nicola Thoms, and the classical piano stylings of Leffeh Man, ‘Sad To See You Go’ is a brilliantly balanced mix of melancholy, soul, and smoothly charged energy. In assembling all of these elements together, Mom Tudie continues to demonstrate his swift rate of creative development. Infused with RnB beats, and a touch of Massive Attack, ‘Sad To See You Go’ is going to be on repeat for quite some time.\n\nYou can find out more information about Mom Tudie [here]( https://www.facebook.com/momtudie.)",
