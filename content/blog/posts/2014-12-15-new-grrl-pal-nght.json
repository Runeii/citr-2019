  "body": "Australian duo **GRRL PAL’s** new single, _NGHT_, sounds scarily like Purity Ring at times, perhaps intentionally so.\n\nThat said, I’m a sucker for this sound, so I’m not complaining. Their third original track, recorded after spending some time in the US, it’s hopefully a indication of much more to come from Jay Lekat and Danny K in 2015. Check it out below, alongside previous track, Paradise.",
