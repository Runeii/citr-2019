  "body": "With his debut album The Year Of Hibernation released next week, Trevor Powers aka Youth Lagoon has dropped one of the bonus tracks set to feature on his first full length effort.\n\nWritten about a close friend, Bobby is a fragile, vocal driven track, gradually building to an epic finale. It’s not quite as forthcoming as Youth Lagoon’s previous works, or indeed the tracks on The Year Of Hibernation, however it’s no less beautiful. Stream Bobby below, and check back later in the week for a review of The Year Of Hibernation.\n\n<a href=\"http://soundowl.com/track/1quf/youth-lagoon-bobby\">Download Youth Lagoon Bobby</a>",
