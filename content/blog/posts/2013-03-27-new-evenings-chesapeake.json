  "body": "**Evenings** released his first tune in a little while on his label, **Friends of Friends**’ compilation, _Show me the Future,_ at the very start of this year.\n\nThe track, _Stays_, made me go fucking nuts. His follow up, taken from his next LP, _Yore_, is rather underwhelming in comparison, focusing on a stronger melody rather than textures or found sound. Regardless, it’s a new Evenings LP, we’re excited. Sream the new cut below.",
