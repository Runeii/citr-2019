  "body": "Manchester’s musical legacy is well documented, so much so that at times people forget that underneath the reunion’s and sold out arena shows, a monstrously vibrant scene is bubbling away, perhaps the strongest of any city at the UK at this moment in time.\n\nLed by standard bearers **SWAYS** records, with releases from **The Louche** and **M O N E Y** amongst others, newest addition **G R E A T W A V E S** are kicking up quite a fuss with their stellar live performances and upcoming single The Shore. Accompanied by a psychedelic live video, their sound draws from shoegaze and, if I dare say, the grittier mod movement of the late 70’s/early 80’s. Check out _The Shore_ below.",
