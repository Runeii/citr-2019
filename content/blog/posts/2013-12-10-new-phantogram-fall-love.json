  "title": "New: Phantogram – Fall in Love",
  "date": "2013-12-10T14:07:19",
  "body": "The dynamic duo of Josh Carter and Sarah Barthel, aka [Phantogram](http://phantogrammusic.virb.com/), released their newest single “Fall in Love” with the announcement of their upcoming LP, _Voices_, which will be their second full-length album. The single is what you’d expect from [Phantogram](http://phantogrammusic.virb.com/): electronic elements working in unison with traditional instrumentals, pounding background synth rhythms, thoughtful depth of layers. The track begins with strings and gradually adds different elements to become an auditory wonder, which works in harmony with Barthel’s floating lyrics. If this track is any indication of what to expect next from [Phantogram](http://phantogrammusic.virb.com/), _Voices, _set to drop February 18th in the new year, shouldn’t disappoint.",
