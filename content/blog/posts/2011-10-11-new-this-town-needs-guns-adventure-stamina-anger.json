  "body": "In a tone befitting the end of an era, I’m going to get all sentimental for a moment.\n\nI can still remember the first time I really listened to **This Town Needs Guns**. It was probably nearly exactly four years ago. Walking home on a bright, brisk autumn day much like this one, I fished my phone out of my pocket to find a text from a friend, saying simply, ‘Listen to _26 is Dancier than 4_ by This Town Needs Guns’. When I got in, I dutifully fired up the computer, pulled up MySpace, and did so.\n\nI think that no sooner had the song’s last notes faded out (maybe for the third or fourth time), I dialled the individual who had set me on this path and unleashed a torrent of unintelligible gibberish down the line, the gist of which was that TTNG’s marriage of barefaced, unapologetic angst to ultra-melodic hypertapping, was, y’know, just my kind of thing. Suddenly a whole bunch of bands with Kinsella influences proudly on sleeves seemed to appear. Some of them were good. Some were bloody awful, and it all got a bit boring in the end. But I heard This Town Needs Guns before I heard the rest of ’em, and I don’t think they ever really got outdone.\n\n**_Adventure, Stamina & Anger_** is the swansong of Guns’ frontman and sometime guitarist Stuart Smith, who’s departing on particularly happy terms for the realms of fatherhood. Listening to it alongside oldies like _26…_ it’s apparent how much more competent the Oxford-based four piece have become. Where I used to pine for the distorted chording that characterised Guns’ split with Cats & Cats & Cats, the mellifluous clusters of notes that populate **_Adventure_** wouldn’t make sense in that context, but thoroughly do in this one.\n\nThis Town Needs Guns are continuing onward with Henry Tremain (him from [Pennines](http://www.myspace.com/pennines \"They're not around any more. Shame.\")) in place of Smith, and head into the studio to record their second full length next week. You can download **_Adventure, Stamina & Anger_** via the Guns [bandcamp](http://thistownneedsguns.bandcamp.com/album/adventure-stamina-anger \"I'm spent.\"), or head over to [hellomerch](http://hellomerch.com/sh/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&page=shop.browse&category_id=43&Itemid=2 \"Hello, merch!\") to preorder a physical copy.
