Two tracks, _Whisper_ and a self-titled number, both are unfurling beauties, characterised by their imperfect yet devastatingly honest vocals and minimal instrumentation. Of the two, the self-titled is the more complete number, bewitching in atmosphere and lyrical content – _‘don’t you run down / to the oceans in your mind / don’t you ever scream / for release’_. There’s hints of Thom Yorke in the despondent vocals and touches of Alt-J amongst the hazy guitar lines, both combining to utterly unique effect.",
