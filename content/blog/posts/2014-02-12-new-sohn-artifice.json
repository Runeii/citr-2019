  "date": "2014-02-12T19:44:05",
  "body": "Having started his musical career as **SOHN** with an edge of mystery, the London via Vienna songwriter and producer has spent the last year or so stepping out of the shadows.\n\nWith his debut shows little over a year ago, and his first London show less than six months ago, he quite rightly found himself on numerous ones to watch lists for 2014. Earlier this evening he announced his debut album, titled _**Tremors**_, set to be released 7 April via 4AD, with new track _Artifice_ set to be featured on the LP.\n\nAs with his work with BANKS and Kwabs, the production is as immaculate as ever, and his songwriting is as magical as to be expected. More upbeat than his initial offerings, it’s further proof that SOHN is destined for a colossal year.",
