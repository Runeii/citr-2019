  "body": "Having previously written for Bondax and featured on a Chase & Status track, London’s **Ed Thomas** is set for a big year.\n\nHis debut solo single On My Own is part Miami Vice, part 80’s soul, with bold, lustful synths merging fluidly with his pitch-perfect vocals. Oh, and if you’re wondering, the beautiful art comes from Samuel Johnson (Ta-ku, The 1975, Forty Ounce).",
