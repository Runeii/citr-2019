  "body": "Artists like **Mood Indigo** are the main reason why I write a music blog.\n\nWhilst their music may not be reaching huge numbers of ears at this moment in time, it’s the talent that these sort of musicians have that makes them so rewarding to write about. Having impressed with previous releases, Boston’s Mood Indigo aka Bailey Lawless, shuffles in somewhere between **Animal Collective** and **Why?** with his hip-hop production and lofty, slightly psychedelic vocals. Newest release, four track EP **_Welcome To The Woods_** is potentially his most complete release to date, ranging from the psych-pop of Hint Of Color to the 80’s hip-hop vibe of Good Man Lost.",
