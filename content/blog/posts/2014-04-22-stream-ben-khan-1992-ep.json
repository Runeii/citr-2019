  "body": "One of the fastest rising artists of the year and king of the rapidly growing ‘future-soul’ movement, London’s **Ben Khan** has just made his debut EP, _**1992**_, available to stream in full.\n\nFeaturing four tracks released over the course of the past nine months or so (now in re-worked, fully fleshed forms), it’s far and away the most impressive, ambitious EP of 2014 thus far. From the murky, slightly ominous sounding Drive (Part 1) to the far more pop orientated swagger of Youth, it’s a mightily refreshing release. With the EP now out there for [purchase](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/1992-ep/id843286438?ign-mpt=uo%3D4) and streaming, here’s hoping that the live show is just round the corner.",
