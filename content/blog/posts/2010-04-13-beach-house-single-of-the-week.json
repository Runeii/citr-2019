And what a slice it is! Filled with warm intertwining melodies and quietly reverberating synths, the result is a beautiful piece of dream filled pop. The sound seems to defy logic, simple yet euphoric and swirling.\n\nThe same can be said for Victoria Legrand’s vocals, seeming almost effortlessly intense in their conception. The words reach out to the listener as well as pulling them in; filled with Romantic imagery, the band go to some lengths to allow us into their world; a world that’s both spiritual while still having one eye on reality.\n\nIn many ways Victoria Legrand’s vocals define the sound as a whole, effortlessly intense in most engaging of ways. ‘Zebra’ is proof that sometimes a little can go a very long way.\n\n[Zebra](http://www.mediafire.com/?zjm2kumy4mr)\n\n[Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/beachhousemusic)",
