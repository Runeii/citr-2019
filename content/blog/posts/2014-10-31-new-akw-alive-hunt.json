  "body": "It’s 1AM and I can’t sleep.\n\n**AKW** are pretty much the perfect remedy. Their newest track, _To Be Alive_, lifted from an EP out tomorrow, is quite possibly their finest yet, and without intending to sound patronising, definitely a noticeable step-up. Part Daughter, part London Grammar, To Be Alive is beautiful throughout, easily one of my favourite listens of the year. Check out the video for it below, alongside another new track, the equally brilliant, The Hunt, and grab the EP [here](https://akwsound.bandcamp.com/).",
