  "body": "I wouldn’t usually write about either of these bands but the juxtaposition is just too good to miss.\n\nThe Wild Beasts have turned Lady Gaga’s outrageously 80’s single ‘Yoü And I’ into a whole different kind of Monster. Stream the song & check out the video below.\n\nThe remix is also aiming to raise awareness about ways people can support the labels that lost stock in the Pias UK warehouse fire during the london riots. Links to donate can be found through [the AIM website](http://musicindie.com/news/1131).\n\nHayden Thorpe told the Guardian: “The unlikeness of this match was perhaps what compelled us to take it on. Gaga in many ways is the epitome of what we are not. She is the butcher to our butter knife. The essential thrill is always to keep eluding what is expected of us and what we expect of ourselves.”",
