Well, yeah, that’s pretty much the case.\n\nAs with the likes of **xxyyxx**, **Beat Culture** and **Hollow Pigeons**, NY’s **Yume** (presumably pronounced You-Me) appears to find his inspiration amongst rap and glo-fi artists, with his debut EP _**Dreamt Of U**_ showcasing a decidedly raw and illustriously unrefined talent.\n\nWith cuts from the EP already having popped up on several other blogs ([Flashlight Tag](http://flashlighttagmusic.tumblr.com/post/31342150381), [Smoke Don’t Smoke](http://smokedontsmoke.com/post/31472186699), [GITNB](http://thenewblack.tumblr.com/post/31476343970/2gether-yume-experiments-in-love-and-synth-via?og=1&fb_action_ids=10101540934686343&fb_action_types=tumblr-feed%3Apost&fb_source=other_multiline&action_object_map={%2210101540934686343%22%3A428796457155579}&action_type_map={%2210101540934686343%22%3A%22tumblr-feed%3Apost%22}&action_ref_map=[])) over the last few days, it’s clear that he’s already making an immediate impact on the scene. Personal favourite, the **Imogen Heap’s** _Speeding Cars_ sampling _There There_ is awash with gorgeous hooks and lush instrumentation, a track with such an alluring atmosphere that it’s impossible to not be emotionally affected.
