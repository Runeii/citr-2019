Although Beatham references the virtual his use of materials is very broad, making scaled down models of buildings, plastic vacuum-formed plates, pen and pencil drawings as well as video and web art.\n\n[![Proposed Solo Show (2013) - James Beatham](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tumblr_mn7ih19TQq1ssp3fjo1_1280-e1392117216915.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-admin/<iframe src=\"/player.vimeo.com/video/76439652\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>)\n\n[![Proposed Solo Show (2013) - James Beatham](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tumblr_mn7ig7IbRt1ssp3fjo1_1280.jpg)](http://proposedsoloshow.tumblr.com)Beatham’s _Proposed Solo Show_ (2013) is a two part piece. The first part is a video piece shot in first person, that documents a mocked-up solo show of Beatham’s own work created using Google [Sketchup](http://www.sketchup.com/products/sketchup-pro). The other piece is an miniature model of the exhibition in the video, allowing the viewer to watch the video walkthrough whilst having the opportunity to use the model as a reference point.\n\n![Videogame Landscapes (2013) (Stills) - James Beatham](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/one.jpg)[![Videogame Landscapes (2013) (Stills) - James Beatham](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/two.jpg)](http://www.jamesbeatham.net/videogame%20landscape/video/index.html)Beatham also explores landscapes and crossovers between real and virtual that are unclear if what you are seeing is of a real mountain shot with a dodgy video camera or that of a video game. The video continues through various landscapes with the viewer still unclear of the source of these views. That is, however, until the sound of a wind instrument builds up. It starts with soft drum beats that are followed by sharp violin notes that seem semi-familiar to the theme tune Nintendo’s video game, ‘_Zelda_‘. Then you start to realise the flatness of cliff faces and it all becomes apparent that everything you have been watching has been scenes collaged from video games.\n\n[![Videogame Landscapes (2013) (Stills) - James Beatham](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/purple-sunset.jpg)](http://www.jamesbeatham.net/videogame%20landscape/video/index.html)\n\nBeathham has a great light hearted way to combine the crossover from two worlds, real and virtual into something that is charming and witty.\n\nJames Beatham has exhibited at **[Hoxton Garage](http://www.thehoxtongarage.co.uk/#)** (2013) and **[The Concourse Gallery](http://www.concoursegallery.co.uk)**(2013) in Archway, keep a look out because hopefully we will see more great work from James Beatham in the future.\n\nIn the meantime email Beatham for a dance, if you like the Macarena?[http://www.jamesbeatham.net/dance/dancer.html](http://www.jamesbeatham.net/dance/dancer.html)\n\nTo see more of James Beathams work heres his website\n\n[http://www.jamesbeatham.net](http://www.jamesbeatham.net)",
