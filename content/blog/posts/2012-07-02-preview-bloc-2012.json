  "body": "Let’s be fucking honest, **BLOC 2012** splits the general public into 3 distinct categories.\n\n1\\. People who are going to **BLOC** 2. People who wish they were going to **BLOC**. and 3. People who don’t want to and therefore won’t be reading this article.\n\nSo to address the 2 camps; ‘good for you’ and ‘sucks bro, maybe next year?’\n\nThe line-up is, as expected, rather freakin super: **Orbital, Flying Lotus, Snoop, Squarepusher, Steve Reich, Amon Tobin, Four Tet, James Blake**…I’m losing the will to type, so [**here’s the complete run-down**](http://www.blocweekend.com/lineup/).\n\nSo anyway, to those who are going, have a great time. And to those who aren’t re-read my earlier commiseration above.\n\nOh and if this article seems half arsed, that’s because it is. But a brother has to get his VIP press passes somehow right?\n\nSeriously though, we couldn’t be more excited for BLOC; check out some of our top tips below.\n\n**Illum Sphere **\n\n**Hype Williams **\n\n**Actress**\n\n**Nicolas Jaar**\n\n**T. Williams **\n\n**Boddika **\n\n**Pariah **\n\n**Redinho**\n\nGrab the last few day tickets [**HERE**.](http://www.blocweekend.com/tickets/) We see you all there this weekend!",
