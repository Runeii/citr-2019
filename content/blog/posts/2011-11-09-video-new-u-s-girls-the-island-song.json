  "body": "With the news surfacing that lo-fi songstress **U.**\n\n**S. Girls** had signed to FatCat, only moments after her LP **_Girls on Kraak_** was released on [Kraak](http://kraak.net/), (see what she did?), it appears the artist is turning heads in the industry. The first single to come from the record is a detachment from her other efforts, yet no less gratifying.\n\nHer hiccup-like vocals and brooding synth work give the whole thing a pained and troubling edge. The new 7” single also comes with a self-directed video; it’s not as good as the tune, but hey, you can’t have it all.\n\nStream the video and track below and buy the single [here.](http://calicocorp.bandcamp.com/album/the-island-song-7)",
