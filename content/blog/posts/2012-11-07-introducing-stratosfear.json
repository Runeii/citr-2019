  "body": "Bloggers starting labels can be disastrous, particularly when it comes to judging the relationship between ‘hype’ and ‘demand’, however given Berlin / Oslo based music blog [No Fear Of Pop’s](nofearofpop.net) impeccable music taste, there’s no way that their new venture **Stratosfear** can be anything other than a phenomenal success. Considering that NFOP is arguably my favourite independent music blog, it’s safe to say that I’m VERY excited for the future of this fantastic project. Introduced to the world via our friend [Disco Naivete](http://disconaivete.com/post/35199310210), the 7″ label will begin with a release from Montreal duo **Solar Year**, titled _**Night & Day**_. Check out **Solar Year’s** _Lines_ below, and hit up the [Stratosfear Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stratosfearx) for more info.",
