Describing themselves as “a female fronted synth pop band featuring current and ex members of Lavotchkin & End Reign, as well as local producers Joey Murphy, Worry Party & RoadToCairo”, there’s definite hints of CHVRCHES, M83 and CitR favourites Ecstasy in their bold, near-athemic debut track, Breathe. Perhaps not quite as ‘clean’ as the aforementioned acts, however it’s early days, and it’s a mightily promising first outing.",
