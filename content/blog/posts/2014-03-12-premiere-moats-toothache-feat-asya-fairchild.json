  "body": "Simple yet elegant song writing is a difficult art to perfect.\n\nSticking to a genre formula too rigidly leads to derivativeness, whilst purposely diverging from genre structure can fall into self parody. **Moats** have walked this fine line with their new cut _Toothache_, seemingly with a degree of ease. It’s guitar music, it’s modern guitar music, and sticks to structure for sure, but it does so with such conviction and certainty it falls quite comfortably into the realms of memorability. A featuring slot from **Asya Fairchild** is also a great conclusion  \nWe’re stoked to premiere the rather dramatic new video for the track, check it out below.\n\n)",
