  "body": "Having already shared stages with the likes of Woodkid, Ibeyi, and Emile Simon, amongst others, it’s evident the sort of creative circles that **TALLISKER** moves in.\n\nHailing from France, yet now residing in Glasgow, _Salanfe_, the first taste from her forthcoming Heliotrop EP is an uncompromisingly brilliant, classical inspired number. Touches of the likes of Bjork and Portishead shine through, yet are seamlesslly merged with almost punk orientated influences in the ferocity and energy of the track.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
