  "body": "A nice soulful pop single from New York’s **Sinkane** was released today via his Bandcamp – and it’s a lovely little single at that.\n\nThe singer-songwriter has performed as a drummer for **Of Montreal**, **Caribou**, and most recently, **Yeasayer**. He’s new to the whole solo thing, but an album is imminent – from this track alone you can get an idea of the simple but expansive sound he’s going for.\n\nNot as campy as **Yeasayer**‘s recent output, I dare say, but still quite friendly. The best thing about this single is Dan Snaith, also known as the genius behind **Caribou**, under his electronic moniker **Daphni**, has done a drawn-out electrified remix. Similar to his edit of **Orchestra Of Sphere**‘s track last year, Snaith ‘goes lite’ on the track – modestly tossing it onto the dancefloor with not too much fuss and flair. I make it sound bad by saying that – if you know Snaith’s recent work, you’ll know how incredible it’s been (I don’t even need to mention **Caribou**‘s _Swim_ and his **Radiohead** remix).\n\nBoth the original of this track and the **Daphni** mix are both a nice surprise. You can download the EP for ‘name your price’ over at Bandcamp below. Be sure to keep an eye out for **Sinkane**‘s debut album, and whatever **Daphni** has next up his sleeve!\n\n_Hear and/or download Runnin’ below, with remixes by Daphni and Chandeliers._\n\n<a href=\"http://sinkane.bandcamp.com/album/runnin\">Runnin&#8217; by SINKANE</a>",
