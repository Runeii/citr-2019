Before I go on, let me clarify that I use the word racket in an entirely complimentary way when discussing **Michael Christmas**. After posting a collection of nine demo tracks on their [bandcamp](http://dalijensen.bandcamp.com/album/demos) earlier this month, I’ve been well and truly hooked on their brand of no-punches held, grungy rock. Mixing the warm fuzz of **Wavves** with guitars that bring back pleasant memories of **The Refused**, these guys know precisely how to generate a dirty, raw sound.\n\nOf the nine tracks available so far, highlights include the no strings attached rock of _MEETHead_ and the slightly more subdued, but no-less-awesome _…you oughta know_. The vocals are distorted and delivered with a passionate agitation, the guitars are coarse and driven, and the overall energy of the tracks is quite astounding. Imagine **The Vaccines** but with balls and instead of chiseling formulaic, outdated indie tracks, they gave it their undying all; then they’d probably sound a bit like **Michael Christmas**. Head over to their bandcamp to download the demo collection for free.",
