  "body": "San Francisco trio **There’s Talk** conjured up one of the most majestic tracks of 2013 in the form of CitR featured _The Salt_.\n\nSomewhere between the angelic innocence of London Grammar, and the bittersweet beauty of St. Vincent, they’ve matched the elegance of the track with stunning visuals, directed by Marta Dymek. A difficult video to transfer into words, there’s an otherworldliness to the visuals that set them a part from anything else I’ve seen these year. From the luxurious costumes, to the idyllic settings, it’s absolute perfection. Check it out below.",
