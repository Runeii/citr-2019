  "body": "As a backing vocalist / keys player for London outfit Club Kuru, it’s safe to say that Thandi has seen her fair share of hype in recent years.\n\nWhilst the group have spent the past few months recording new material, Thandi has also found time to lay down some solo tracks of her own – produced by drummer Graham Godfrey. Her debut offering, Forgetful is a glorious slice of R&B influenced psychedelia; all underpinned by a funky, real 80’s sounding beat. With more tracks expected over the coming months, you can bet that 2016 is shaping up rather well for **Thandi**. Check out Forgetful below.",
