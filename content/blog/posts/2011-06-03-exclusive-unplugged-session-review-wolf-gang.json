Nonetheless, and despite the wind gods interfering, London-based pop rock band Wolf Gang were kind enough to sit down and deliver a fantastic acoustic variation on their next single, _The King and All of His Men_. Check it out below.\n\nTheir show itself, at Newcastle’s Cluny, was an absolute triumph. Supports came from old CITR friends Mammal Club, who delivered the sort of white knuckle, energetic set that we’ve really come to expect from them, and singer-songwriter Kyla La Grange, whose powering vocals and instrumentation proved a hit with the crowd (though, if truth be told, didn’t quite reach the heights that were provided by Mammal Club and Wolf Gang themselves).\n\nWolf Gang themselves took to the stage shortly after and played through their upcoming album, _Suego Faults._ It was the little things in particular that proved to be so impressive here – from the lighting, to the smoke, to the dandy-like stage presence of founder and frontman, Max McElligott, who played the crowd right into his palm. Much like their [debut EP](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/5740-review-wolf-gang-dancing-with-the-devil-ep), where certain songs were good, others were truly great. It is the big, anthemic, singalong tracks where Wolf Gang really triumph live – from the (quite shocking) raw power of opener _Dancing with the Devil_, through to _The King and All of His Men_, my new personal favourite _Stay and Defend_, right up to the truly epic closer of _Lions in Cages_. Even certain tracks from that EP, such as _Something Unusual_ and _Back to Back_, which I initially thought fell slightly short of the standard set by these songs, were delivered with such intensity live that any criticisms I had simply evaporated. But it is the former songs that not only worked so well live (and I maintain would work even better in a large venue or at a festival), but actually got the whole crowd moving – not easy to do in an intimate venue. And then, right at the end of it, having spent 45 minutes acting more of a rock star than most rock stars today, singer/frontman Max McElligott strolled right out of the band room and started chatting to fans.\n\nThe band’s tour continues on through the rest of this month, with a couple of festival dates this Summer. Go see them now – because if there’s any justice in the world, Wolf Gang are destined for greatness.",
