  "date": "2013-05-23T16:00:29",
  "body": "With their debut track _Umbrella_ having cemented their position as one of the most exciting acts to come from the North East in recent years, South Shields quartet [Arbeia](http://www.arbeia.org/#221/soundcloud) look set to take the rest of the UK by storm. _Dukkha_, a Buddhist term for anxiety, continues their growth and encapsulates the energy and painstaking attention to detail that forms such a pivotal part of their live performances. Jerky Foals-esque guitars paired with epic, soaring vocals and a healthy dose of early 00’s American pop-punk, makes _Dukkha_ an invigorating and engrossing listen, and is sure to form the foundations of further success for **Arbeia**. Check it out below, and be sure to get there early for their show at [Evolution Emerging](http://www.generator.org.uk/EVOLUTIONEMERGING) this Saturday, 7.45 at The Cumberland Arms.",
