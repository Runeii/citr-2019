A **[Shlohmo](http://soundcloud.com/ivvvo/shlohmo-big-feelings-ivvvo)** remix followed, as well as a handful of white label singles that never really delivered, but did managed to fill in some blanks in the story.\n\nHis next full EP however, is remarkably more accomplished. It aims at a similar sound; deep brooding synths, industrial beats and sampled human cries for help all feature, as in his earlier work, yet the palette with he accomplishes these sounds is increasingly varied. It seems that **IVVVO** has perfected his craft into something that’s darkly poetically yet vividly simple.\n\nDownload the record below, out now on **Terrain Ahead Records**.",
