  "body": "Having been hard at work since the release of his debut EP simply titled I, **Spirits Of Leo** aka Ryan Santos Phillips is back with the first track taken from his debut album.\n\nMore industrial sounding than the dream-pop of his first outing, _Ghost Story_ draws from the rougher shogaze elements, more Ride than Slowdive or **Pale Saints**. _‘I don’t wanna lie / thoughts make me terrified / scared to be asleep / far too numb to shut my eyes’_, it’s the documentation of inner turmoil and restless belonging. Check it out below, taken from the forthcoming Spirits of Leo debut album **_Anastasia_**.",
