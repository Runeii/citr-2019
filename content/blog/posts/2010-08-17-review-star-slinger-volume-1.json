  "body": "![](http://www.starslinger.net/biography_files/selection.png \"Star Slinger\")Having already dabbled his toes in the colourful, chromatic waters of dance music, **Darren Williams** aka **Star Slinger** began to find himself constrained to certain genres and artists, a convention that his extensive vinyl collection would simply not allow. So despite receiving plays from Radio 1 as well as support from **Paul Van Dyk**, **Williams** spread his roots, and took up producing beat tapes, and with just one listen to his recent release _Volume 1_, it appears there has been no hesitant looking back from **Star Slinger**.\n\nComing in at just over thirty minutes, _Volume 1_ is a turbulent and pulsating ride, racing through all genres from reggae, 90’s soul and 80’s hip hop. There is no doubting **Darren’s** skills at mixing and sampling, so it’s no surprise to learn that he’s been producing since he was 14, spending his pocket money on purposefully purchasing a computer for that very use. First two tracks _Mornin’_ and _Minted_ are fantastic introductions, the hand clapped beat on the opener is distinctive and complimented beautifully by the soulful vocals.\n\n_Dutchie Courage_ is arguably the most adventurous moment on the record, sampling the classic 80’s track by **Musical Youth**, underlaying a simple yet infectious beat. Uplifting, jovial and blissful, a brilliant example of the skills **Williams** has at his disposal. He hasn’t completely shunned his dance roots, and some of the vocal samples especially could easily fit into a Saturday night floorfiller, however it’s the way in which **Star Slinger** constructs and ties the tunes together that makes the record. There is a sparkling kaleidoscopic feel to _Volume 1_, each tune takes the record in a different, erratic direction, yet it’s insanely enslaving. Family Friend includes a reggae style beat, with a tinkling piano, an exotic but triumphant sound.\n\n_Volume 1_ by **Star Slinger** goes to show that as well as having dazzling skills, it’s also of vital importance to have a wide and impressive knowledge of a variety of music styles, allowing him to collate ideas magnificently. As if the release itself wasn’t enough, you’ll also be please to know that **Darren Williams** has thoroughly embraced the musical download culture we live in today, by making **Volume 1** available for free download from his official site. Make sure to check back in the next few days for an interview with **Star Slinger.**\n\n[Check Out Star Slinger’s Official Site!](http://www.starslinger.net/home.html)",
