  "body": "Yet another act whom I unintentionally missed at this years Great Escape Festival, Canadian trio **Gold & Youth** kicked somewhat of a fuss on their brief UK jaunt, and quite rightly so given the strength of _Time To Kill_.\n\nA track that appeared on the internet a month or two back, _Time To Kill_ is an indie anthem of epic proportions; all floaty, intertwining male/female vocals and booming synth sections. The accompanying video echoes the dark, slightly mysterious feel to the group, shot entirely in black and white and following the tumultuous journey of what one assumes to be a young couple. Check out _Time To Kill_ below.",
