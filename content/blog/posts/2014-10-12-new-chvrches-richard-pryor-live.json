  "body": "I’ve been saying for a while now that I’m fascinated by the clutch of British bands that have broken into the ‘mainstream’ across the course of the past two or three years, and even more so when it comes to what their second albums will have in store.\n\nThe likes of Bastille, The 1975, London Grammar are all set to follow up colossal debut albums, and no doubt attempt to make the step up to festival headliner status. Another such act who are guaranteed to be there or thereabouts are **CHVRCHES**; granted their ascent has been a more gradual build, it’s also seen them have huge success in America and Australia.\n\nOver the past few weeks they’ve been trying out a currently untitled new track, altering the name each night. It’s been ‘Eddie Murphy’, ‘Gene Wilder’ and most recently at Austin City Limits, going under the working title ‘_Richard Pryor_‘. Thankfully, pretty decent quality audio has surfaced from their ACL show, check it out below.",
