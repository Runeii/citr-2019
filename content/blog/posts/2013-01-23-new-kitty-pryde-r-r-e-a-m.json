With immaculate production from the ever awesome **GRANT**, _R.R.E.A.M._ (a hat-tip to WU TANG’s C.R.E.A.M.) contains the now expected level of self-depreciation and cutesy wit from Kitty. In such a male dominant genre, it’s refreshing to hear a white, female rhyming with such ease and apparent confidence. Check out _R.R.E.A.M._ (Rash Rules Everything Around Me) below.
