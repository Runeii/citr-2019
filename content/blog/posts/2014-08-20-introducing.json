With a handful of tracks on Soundcloud all uploaded within the course of the past month, it’s clearly very early days for **Ours.** yet there’s easily enough to suggest that they have the potential to be a force to be reckoned with.

Check out _Holy War_, _Sink With Me_ and _Fall In Line_ below, as well as more over at their [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/ours-4).",
