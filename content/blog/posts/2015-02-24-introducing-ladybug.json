  "body": "Primarily the creative outlet of Mara Neves and João Portela, **Ladybug** may well be one of the only artists from Portugal that CitR has covered in the almost five years of existence.\n\nCalling in a few friends and acquaintances for their debut four track EP, it’s a colourful, elegant release; characterised by it’s sweeping, string sections. From the obvious lead track, _Black Dog_, to the more refined yet equally as poignant _Good Fortune_, it’s an EP of colossal potential, and one that would no doubt make for a stunning live performance. Check out a few of the tracks below, and grab the full EP from [Bandcamp](http://ladybugmusica.bandcamp.com/releases).",
