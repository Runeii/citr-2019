  "body": "Since the release of the excellent _**Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix** _back in 2009, **Phoenix** have deservedly become a pretty big deal, playing huge gigs at places like [Madison Square Garden](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWD2rmpoYeM&list=UUNDAbwbXmmgosddFdUyRWwg&index=3 \"Phoenix at Madison Square Garden\") and the [Eiffel Tower](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHwucdjtkgU \"Phoenix - Take Away Show\") (well, kind-of). But the downside has been we haven’t had any new music from the Parisian boys for a while – until now. After recently releasing more details on their forthcoming L.P,_ **Bankrupt!**_, they’ve now dropped the first single, _Entertainment,_ as Zane Lowe’s hottest record in the world today on BBC Radio 1.\n\nThey haven’t reined in the high-end, synth led production since their last outing – it’s slick, grandiose, and according to the current highest rated comment on the very professional looking ‘homemade’ YouTube lyric video, even has a bit of “japanese vibe” going on. But it’s when the song drops down in the verses – to the tried-and-tested driving sound of bass, muted guitars and steady drums – there’s space given for the welcome reminder that in Thomas Mars, **Phoenix **have a lead singer with a seriously fine ear for great, catchy melodies. It’s good to have them back.",
