  "body": "Mark my words, **Lorde** is the real deal.\n\nWith a number one single in New Zealand, a (reportedly huge) record label contract signed and support from almost every ‘quirky’ popstar on the planet, she’s a 16 year old with a blisteringly bright future. This new, extremely minimal video for recent release _Tennis Courts_ almost feels like something I might have set as my screensaver back in 2006 on my desktop to show my friends how ‘alt’ I was. Focusing on a near motionless **Ella Yelich-O’Connor **for the entirety of the clip, she swings in time to the track, adding the occasionally mouthed ‘YEAAH’. Engrossing, but hardly begging repeat viewings, it speaks volumes to the quality of the track that it manages to remain so engaging. Check out _Tennis Courts_ below.",
