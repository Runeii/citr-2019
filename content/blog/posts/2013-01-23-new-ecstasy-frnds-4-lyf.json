  "body": "London group **Ecstasy** keep pulling the hits out the bag, and whilst new track FRNDS 4 LYF is perhaps less immediate than the recently released [Exhale](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/19031-new-ecstasy-exhale/), it’s sure to keep their names on the lips of every A&R around the country. More sugary sweet than their other material, it’s still characterised by it’s booming synth sections and dance inspired hook. With little information available about the band, and a consistently impressive quality of music, it’s surely only a matter of time before they’re snapped up by one of the coolest labels around.",
