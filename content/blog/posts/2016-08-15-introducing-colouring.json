  "body": "A couple of years back a young London band appeared destined for festival headline status.\n\nMerging Coldplay-esque vocals with stadium ready songwriting, Osca soundtracked Sky Sports montages, became a mainstay of early evening radio playlists, and began shifting decent tickets, then as is so often the case, they disappeared. Now reformed / re-imagined, with a perhaps less accessible but slicker sound, **Colouring** manage to hold on to some of the instantaneously addictive songwriting. Of the four tracks released thus far, _In Motion_ stands out as being the most ambitious – intertwining a Radiohead inspired guitar line with a gorgeous vocal topline. Check out a couple of tracks below.\n\nLike this?
