  "body": "_I refuse to escape, the pains and the aches // I choose to be sober and suffer for the choices I make_\n\nAnother track from Georgia based Alone appeared online late last week and Burden is as desolate as ever.\n\nWith the most traditional beat of Alone’s tracks so far, Burden is still stripped down and minimal. Tyler Rowan loops chimes whilst self deprecating lyrics flow from Rico Howard’s mouth.\n\nMaybe not polished yet but with potential, Alone are one I’ll be watching.\n\n<a href=\"http://alonega.bandcamp.com/album/alone-2\">Alone by Alone</a>",
