  "body": "‘**Blue Daisy presents Dahlia Black**’, the new project from experimental producer **Blue daisy**, as the name suggests.\n\nThe release of their debut track earlier this month blew up a small proportion of the internet, UK hiphop hadn’t been this exciting for a while. **Soosh** released his interpretation of the track onto soundcloud last night, keeping the sinister elements that run through the original track, whilst weaving in more ambient and muted textures, making for a rather jarring mixture of sounds. Really enjoyable listen.",
