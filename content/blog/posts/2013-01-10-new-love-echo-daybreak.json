  "body": "Clocking up an impressive 40,000+ plays of their sophomore track [Lovecats](https://soundcloud.com/loveechomusic/lovecats) (a cover of The Cure) towards the tail end of last year, dreampop duo **Love Echo** have now announced the release of their highly anticipated debut LP, elegantly titled **_I Promise You Always The Sky_**, out on LebensStrasse Records on 28 January. _Daybreak_, the newest cut to be taken from said record is a choppy, mystical number, never truly opening up to the listener nor shielding all of it’s inner, naked beauty. With an abundance of synth-pop duo’s filling up the pages on all the slickest blogs at the moment, **Love Echo** are serious contenders to leave the realms of the internet and blossom into the daunting, commercial abyss in which we all thrive.",
