  "body": "On Tuesday this week I was invited along to the **Danish Embassy** for an opening celebrating the winner of the Embassy Award 2013.\n\nBeing the curious and sometimes opportunistic guy that I am I agreed for two reasons. The first to see some good art, the second to have the opportunity to go inside an embassy!\n\nThe artist whose achievement we are celebrating here is **Asger Harbou Gjerdevik**. He is currently in his second year at **Central Saint Martins** and I took the opportunity to ask him a few questions about the images that he makes.\n\nâ€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-\n\n_DC: How is it to see your work in the context of an embassy?_\n\n_AHG_: To exhibit my work in an embassy is definitely different in comparison to a more conventional gallery space. Mainly because of the space and location. For this exhibition my work is located in the Embassyâ€™s canteen, two corridors and two conference rooms. The work is going to hang there for a year where the people working at the embassy will have to look at it everyday.\n\nWhen I came to make the three paintings for the canteen I had to think through how I could integrate my style, topics and visuals into works that worked in the context of the Embassy and what that represents but also it is a place where people came to eat everyday. So I toned down my usual figurations and symbols e.g. body fluids, penises, flames, graves, dead animals etc. essentially all of the stuff that I usually like to paint and had a more abstract approach to them.\n\nHowever, in the corridors itâ€™s cool â€“ because if people donâ€™t like it they can keep on walking. In a way, the drawings that contain my usual figurations on display in the corridors, which are way smaller than the paintings, engage with the viewer on a different level and its interesting to see what they represent.\n\n_DC: Does it change the way you see the work in anyway?_\n\n_AHG_: No â€“ not really.\n\n_DC: Can you please explain the title â€˜**Without Transition**â€˜ a little further?_\n\n_AHG_: I think that titles are always difficult. All my work so far are untitled â€“ and when I had to come up with a title for the exhibitionÂ  â€“ I didnâ€™t really know what I would call it. To begin with I wanted to call it _Heavy Liquid_, I think it has a nice sound to it, and it can refer to the material used to make the work â€“ paint â€“ that is also a heavy liquid. It is also a title of a song by **The Stooges** which I also reference in some of the works in the exhibition. Unfortunately the embassy didnâ€™t really like that title so much â€“ so I had to come up with another one.\n\nSo I recalled the old Surrealist trick to find a title. Where you take your favorite book, close your eyes and scroll through the book. You then place your finger on a random word on a random page and use that word as a title. At the time I was reading **_Naked Lunch_**, so I took the book closed my eyes and scrolled through and pointed at the title _Without Transition_. I thought about it, and felt it had some poetic feel to it and I kept it at that.\n\n_Without Transition_ can be applied what I do as well as where I have come from. In connection to what I do, I have the same approach to painting as I have to drawing or to woodcuts. This is that same with my approach to materials, I donâ€™t limit myself by only using acrylic, for example, there can be pencil, markers, ink, spray paint, bleach, epoxy, resin and so forth.\n\n_DC: Can you briefly describe any influences that have contributed to your style of image making?_\n\n_AHG_: Tough questionâ€¦ I will try to answer briefly. Anything from **Larry Poons** to **Robert Crumb**Â or from cave paintings to sci-fi films.\n\n_DC: I noticed that your work has quite a graphic feel to it and I was just wondering how you see your work in relation to graphics in general?_\n\n_AHG_: I see my work very much involved with **graphics**. It might even be more involved with graphics than traditional painting. Or actually it is. Yes I use geometry, lines, symbols, illustration and text â€“ yes I am quite interested in form and anti-form and the dualism of the visual elements. Creating a space or a language that is more than a one to one representation.\n\n_DC: And finally, whatâ€™s next for you?_\n\n_AHG_: For now I am just going to work and have fun. Then I have been asked to participate in a group exhibition at **The Danish Cultural Institute** in **Edinburgh**. The exhibition is showing young emerging Danish artists living and working in the UK. So I will work on that. It is on in September/October 2013.\n\nThen hopefully I can spend more time printing at **Byam Shaw**!\n\nâ€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-\n\nFirstly, CONGRATULATIONS to Asger once again for winning the prize and also a huge thank you for the interview.\n\nSecondly, I would also like to mention Mette Hammer Juhl and thank her for inviting me into her countryâ€™s embassy, a place that I am very unlikely to have access to again.\n\nFinally, I apologise for my terrible photographs but check back soon and I shall have the most marvellous images of Asgerâ€™s fantastic work for your delectation ðŸ™‚\n\nUPDATE: Installation shots added.\n\n#gallery-1 { margin: auto; } #gallery-1 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } #gallery-1 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-1 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } /\\* see gallery\\_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php \\*/\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/asger013-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21028-interview-asger-harbou-gjerdevik/attachment/asger013)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/asger012-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21028-interview-asger-harbou-gjerdevik/attachment/asger012)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/asger011-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21028-interview-asger-harbou-gjerdevik/attachment/asger011)\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/asger010-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21028-interview-asger-harbou-gjerdevik/attachment/asger010)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/asger009-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21028-interview-asger-harbou-gjerdevik/attachment/asger009)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/asger008-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21028-interview-asger-harbou-gjerdevik/attachment/asger008)\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/asger007-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21028-interview-asger-harbou-gjerdevik/attachment/asger007)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/asger006-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21028-interview-asger-harbou-gjerdevik/attachment/asger006)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/asger005-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21028-interview-asger-harbou-gjerdevik/attachment/asger005)\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/asger004-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21028-interview-asger-harbou-gjerdevik/attachment/asger004)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/asger003-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21028-interview-asger-harbou-gjerdevik/attachment/asger003)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/asger002-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21028-interview-asger-harbou-gjerdevik/attachment/asger002)\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/asger001-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21028-interview-asger-harbou-gjerdevik/attachment/asger001)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_1361-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21028-interview-asger-harbou-gjerdevik/attachment/img_1361)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_1359-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21028-interview-asger-harbou-gjerdevik/attachment/img_1359)\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_1357-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/21028-interview-asger-harbou-gjerdevik/attachment/img_1357)",
