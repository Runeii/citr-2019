  "body": "**[Pandr Eyez](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/11770-video-pandr-eyez-eyes-on-you/ \"Video: Pandr Eyez – Eyes On You\")** have been friends of the site for a little while now, even headlining **[Brainchild Festival](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/17389-brainchild-festival-a-word-from-citr/ \"Brainchild Festival: A Word From CitR\")** this summer, (they fucking killed it). The thing is, **Pandr Eyez** are doing what so many kids are doing at the moment; taking the age old Rn’B formula, grabbing a new-wave producer and hoping something sticks. **Pandr Eyez** are no different, at least on paper, but they do it with such class and vigour it’s near impossible not to be won over. Check their new single below.\n\n[Physical Education is due out on](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/physical-education-single/id571260756?uo=4) out on Double Denim on November 26.",
