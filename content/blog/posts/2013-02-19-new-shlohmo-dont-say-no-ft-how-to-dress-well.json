  "date": "2013-02-19T08:21:31",
  "body": "A brand new cut from the new **Shlohmo** EP, _Laid Out_, and featuring **How To Dress Well** no less, not a bad thing to wake up to.\n\nAs expected with such a featuring credit , _Don’t Say No_ is noticeably more minimal than the blistering first effort from the EP. This cut however still has an element of malice that left such a wonderfully sour taste in the mouth after listening to debut track, _Later._\n\nHit play below and look out for the full EP on March 5.",
