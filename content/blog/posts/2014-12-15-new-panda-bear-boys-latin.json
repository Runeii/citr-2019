  "body": "Beach Boys-inspired Baltimore boy, Panda Bear, has premièred a new track and animated video from his upcoming album on Adult Swim.\n\n‘Boys Latin’ is the second single from Panda Bear’s forthcoming album _Panda Bear Meets The Grim Reaper_ which is slated for release in January 2015. Watch the full video below.\n\nPanda Bear AKA Noah Lennox is an experimental musician who first shot to fame as a founding member of the band Animal Collective. ‘Boys Latin’ is the second single from his fifth studio album due January 2015. Directed by Isaiah Saxon and Sean Hellfritsch from Encyclopedia Pictura in San Francisco, the film is a psychadelic tripfest. Encyclopedia Pictura are the same guys to bring us video’s for [Metronomy’s ‘The Upsetter’](http://ghostrobot.com/portfolio/metronomy-the-upsetter/), [Bjork’s ‘Wanderlust’](http://ghostrobot.com/portfolio/bjork-wanderlust/) and the magnificent [‘Knife’ by Grizzly Bear](http://ghostrobot.com/portfolio/grizzly-bear-knife/)\n\nIn a press release from Domino Records, director Isaiah Saxon said: _“We tried hard to bring out the vibe of that alternating melody that Noah is singing. We wondered what that should look and feel like from a synesthesia perspective. We’ve always believed that shapes and forms themselves have emotional meaning. For example, round things are often cute and non-threatening, while spiky things usually seem dangerous. We ran with that idea by creating these dynamic forms that grow out of our characters as they deal with their emotions.”_\n\nPanda Bear has also launched a [creepy looking website](http://www.pbvsgr.com/)  to promote his fifth studio album and has a string of upcoming European tour dates. Shows kick off in London on the 4th of March and finishing in Portugal on the 12th.
