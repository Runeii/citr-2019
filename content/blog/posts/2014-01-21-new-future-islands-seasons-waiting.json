  "body": "Nothing quite makes a Tuesday worth working through than a new Future Islands track and video.\n\nTaken from their recently announced ‘Singles’ album set to be released on 4AD on the 24th March, ‘Seasons (Waiting On You)’ is Future Islands at their best with vocalist Samuel T. Herring passionately belting out each line with his own trademark ferocity.\n\nThe video itself is directed by long time collaborater Jay Buim, and focuses on the lives of a rural, cowboy community, looking in on the moments of calm reflection and counterbalanced by the energy and life that is infused in their environment and the relationships they hold.\n\nTouring later this year, you can catch Future Islands at one of the following dates –\n\n07 London, Electric Ballroom\n\n08 Manchester, Sound Control\n\n10 Brighton, The Great Escape",
