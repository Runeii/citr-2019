  "body": "Having released his debut album earlier in the year, **Soft Lighting** aka **Bryan Cox** has unleashed his latest EP entitled _**Glamour Shots**_.\n\nLead single _So Good_ is a languid synth heavy masterpiece, echoing 80’s **Depeche Mode** to illustrious effect, and accompanied by a rather erotic yet fitting video. Showing two young couples exploring each others bodies and their adolescent love for each other, I’m tempted to mark it as NSFW, however whether that’s my cautious manner getting the better of me, who knows. Anyway, check out the saucy video below and stream the full EP via [Bandcamp](http://softlighting.bandcamp.com/album/glamour-shots).",
