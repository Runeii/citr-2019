  "body": "[Anne-Marie](https://www.facebook.com/iamannemarie) (no last name needed), is already a three time world karate champion, and is currently singing her heart out on tour with Rudimental. If that’s not enough achievement for one life, she’s now breaking out on her own, and this track is the first we have from her as a solo artist. Forget My Number is one hell of a start, rooted in soft and sexy RnB. The demo takes aspects of Jessie Ware, TLC and fellow Rudimental vocalist Ella Eyre with Anne-Marie’s smooth voice making it unforgettable.\n\nTake a listen to Forget My Number below, this lady could be set for big things.\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/129967934″ params=”color=ffffff&auto\\_play=false&show\\_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]",
