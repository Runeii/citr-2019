Today the Toronto-based sixtet [**Hooded Fang**](http://www.facebook.com/hoodedfangmusic) have promoted such feelings, carefree and emotional; their music is just what I need.\n\nAt its most basic their new LP, _Tosta Mista,_ is a good old-fashioned Rock n’ Roll album, but it also busts at the seams with raw and uncompromising feelings that make the record seem more expansive than the sound should allow. It’s a proud and raw sound, “I got a woman, that I need to get next to, or I will surely die”, and full of that woozy love-struck atmosphere that can be so irresistible.\n\nStream and buy the album below.",
