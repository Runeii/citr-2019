Set in a downtown dive bar filled with junkies and jukeboxes I imagined a woman possessed by her drunken fantasies that have spun out of control and her eccentricity is reeking of desperation. So following in the old country tradition it’s an upbeat song with a sad and bitter core.”\n\nUpon first listen, _Wonderlust_, the new track from **The Night VI** shot images of nostalgia and long, drawn out road trips through the heart of America straight into my imagination. The jumping synth bass line and soulful melodies clutch the heart, creating an atmosphere that’s part Fleetwood Mac and part John Hughes; It’s hard to believe that the 6 piece band are based in the U.K. The track builds and soars, climaxing in a completely over-the-top guitar solo that makes it pretty damn hard not to smile.\n\nStream _Wonderlust_ above.",
