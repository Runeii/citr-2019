  "body": "Since the departure of [**Sarah P.**](https://www.</p><p>facebook.com/sarannah.p) from **Keep Shelly In Athens** was announced, many people have been eagerly anticipating her next move. Only a few months since she left KSIA, and new project **Fina Fisken** is already here, formed by [**Sarah P.**](https://www.facebook.com/sarannah.p) and producer **Hior Chronik**. **Save The Day** is a sweet surprise that caught me off guard, its dancing house vibes draws its atmosphere from the same source that **Factory Floor** or even **Max Cooper **did, setting the mood for the dreamy, ethereal vocals of [**Sarah P.**](https://www.facebook.com/sarannah.p) to kick in and elevate the whole experience to an otherworldly level. A mesmerising debut track that only promises the best and sucks the listener in to a dreamy state.\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/141058734″ params=”auto\\_play=false&hide\\_related=false&visual=true” width=”100%” height=”450″ iframe=”true” /\\]",
