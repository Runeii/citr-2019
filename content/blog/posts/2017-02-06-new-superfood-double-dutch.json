  "body": "**Superfood’s** debut album, released back in 2014, ended up getting lost amidst a year or two of labels struggling to establish personality and demand for artists, and like a vast majority of acts from that fateful period, I’d almost expected to never hear from them again.\n\nHence my surprise when rumblings toward the end of last year were hinting at a return and some fairly drastic changes for the group – including switching to a two piece. Now signed to Dirty Hit (The 1975, Wolf Alice, The Japanese House & more), the duo are back with a brand new sound on the woozily psychedelic _Double Dutch_, that feels as much indebted to The Avalanches and Gorillaz as it does Tame Impala, yet ultimately sounds absolutely nothing like any of the aforementioned. Check it out below.",
