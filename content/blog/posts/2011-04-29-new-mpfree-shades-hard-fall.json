There are elements of chillwave, pop and electronic influences, ultimately producing a hazy, yet thoroughly listenable track. Released through HolyPage Records as a free download, it certainly sets the bar high for Shades, and personally I’m extremely excited to see what they can conjure up next. Listen to and download Hard Fall below.\n\n<a href=\"http://holypagerecords.bandcamp.com/track/hard-fall\">Hard Fall by HolyPageRecords</a>",
