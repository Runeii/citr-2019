Erek unifies these facets of time – from the natural flow of day and night, the calender and the clock, to musical tempo and nightclub rhythms – They may also be completely subjective and improvised, drawing upon musical creating his own unique interpretation of space. This conflation of natural and man-made measurements of time was demonstrated with fantastic effect on the opening night of the exhibition, with a one off performance that resonated throughout the gallery walls somehow brings together the parallel systems at play throughout the exhibition.\n\nThis unification is mirrored in the architectural layout of the gallery space, and again in the show’s title. The main atrium has been divided horizontally: the lower half is filled with intense sound and blue light, referencing  the night. While the upper remains white and clear, with only the muffled beat from below. Alt: Above Üst: Below. Combining them is suggestive of a mix-up; a collision of time and space.\n\nAlt: Ust provides the viewer with a very personal experience – its sequences and rhythms find their way into your subconscious.\n\nI found myself reminded of a time in my life when the sound of my heartbeat in my ears would bring about a sort of vertigo…manifesting itself into dreams of an advancing of my being to the unknown. That Cevdet Erek has brought this physiological memory back to life for me, at a time when it had been all but forgotten, adds further depth to this already multi-faceted exhibition.\n\nAlt Üst is an intense experience that well and truly deserves attention and a visit to **Spike Island**, **Bristol** from between 15 February to 13 April 2014.\n\nCevdet’s Website [HERE](cevdeterek.com/)\n\n@cevedit\n\nSpike Islands Website [HERE](http://www.spikeisland.org.uk/)\n\n@\\_SpikeIsland\n\n#gallery-1 { margin: auto; } #gallery-1 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } #gallery-1 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-1 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } /\\* see gallery\\_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php \\*/\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/alt-ust8_event_image-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/27030-exhibition-review-alt-ust/attachment/alt-ust8_event_image)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/alt-ust7_event_image-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/27030-exhibition-review-alt-ust/attachment/alt-ust7_event_image)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/alt-ust11_event_image-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/27030-exhibition-review-alt-ust/attachment/alt-ust11_event_image)\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/alt-ust2_event_image-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/27030-exhibition-review-alt-ust/attachment/alt-ust2_event_image)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/alt-ust9_event_image-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/27030-exhibition-review-alt-ust/attachment/alt-ust9_event_image)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/alt-ust1_event_image-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/27030-exhibition-review-alt-ust/attachment/alt-ust1_event_image)\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/alt-ust10_event_image-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/27030-exhibition-review-alt-ust/attachment/alt-ust10_event_image)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1661712_10152258712983735_336403009_n-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/27030-exhibition-review-alt-ust/attachment/1661712_10152258712983735_336403009_n)\n\nImages Taken During Opening Performance\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1743500_10152258712098735_1705180726_n-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/27030-exhibition-review-alt-ust/attachment/1743500_10152258712098735_1705180726_n)\n\nImage Taken During Opening Performance\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/alt-ust3_event_image-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/27030-exhibition-review-alt-ust/attachment/alt-ust3_event_image)\n\nArrythmia",
