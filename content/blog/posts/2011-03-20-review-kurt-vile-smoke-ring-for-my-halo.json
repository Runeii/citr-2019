In largely repudiating his lo-fi influences, he has created an insular, yet inviting album in the heritage of **Tom Petty** and **Elliott Smith**, as he contemplates the private and personal, at odds with the obvious alternative music so regularly touted as revolutionary. Kurt Vile has grown into a witty, cynical artist and it has only benefitted his development from an awkward bedroom troubadour to a confident and unique performer, celebrating the halcyon opportunity of the early seventies.\n\nThere is a subtlety to this album, as it veers from the fragile acoustics of ‘Peeping Tomboy’ to the brawn of the title track, as he subverts **Bright Eyes** to found a melancholy, gorgeous lament to hope and loss. This is a whimsical, laconic record, with ‘Jesus Fever’ standing out as an angular folk song, with the jerking chord changes juxtaposed with the intricate finger picking building a rounded aural experience, at odds with his arguably narrow past works. There is a real sense of progression to the record, a culmination of the undoubtedly vast talents of Vile as he steps beyond his self-imposed generic limitations to embrace a more accessible sound with the aid of his backing band The Violators. ‘Puppet To The Man’ implausibly, and brilliantly, contemporises **The Velvet Underground**, testifying to the sonorous clarity of the record; every pick is now accentuated, with Vile’s voice and poetry a necessity to the depth of the album as a whole. Lou Reed is an obvious influence, but there are also classic rock overtones, infusing a sense of yearning to the record.\n\n_Smoke Ring For My Halo_ is a brilliant album, taking all the potential of his earlier releases to fund a glorious, impulsive journey through seventies alternative America, rich with promise and romance.",
