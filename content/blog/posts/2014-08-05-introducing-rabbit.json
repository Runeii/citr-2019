  "body": "“PSEUDO NIHILISTIC THREE PIECE” is one hell of a way to describe your band; **RABBIT**, you’ve got my attention.\n\nSo the production is far from squeaky clean, yet the key elements are definitely here on this Brisbane bands debut three track EP. Listening to _Treehouse Kings_ I can’t help but feel there’s some sort of Libertines influence in amongst the Two Door Cinema Club / Bombay Bicycle Club / Royal Blood riffs. It’s lovably chaotic, the sort of thing that would have a tent of lairy sixteen year olds going ‘mad for it’ at Leeds Festival. Bags of potential here. Check out all three tracks from the **_DID WE?_** EP below, and download it from [Bandcamp](http://rabbitmusic.bandcamp.com/).",
