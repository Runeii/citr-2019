  "body": "This soulful hip-hop joint from Brooklyn’s **Zen And The Movin’ West** is a late 80’s throwback, combining a thoughtful flow with more modern sampling techniques.\n\nPart of [A Mini Tribe Records](http://aminitriberecords.tumblr.com/), a group I’ve only recently stumbled upon the work of, this gem of a track has some of the slickest production I’ve heard this year. There’s touches of **De La Soul** in the verses and a more soulful R’n’B vibe to the chorus, making _We’ll Be Fine_ a well rounded, enjoyable track. Check out _We’ll Be Fine_ below.",
