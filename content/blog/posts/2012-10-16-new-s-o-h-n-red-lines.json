  "body": "Much has been made of [**S O H N**’s](http://soundcloud.com/sohnmusic) Vienna/London bridge of practice. In many ways it’s perhaps a simple fact to fill some space until the eventual soundcloud link, a fact to impress your mates when you talk of ‘that new hot producer’, whatever, people are talking about it. For me though it’s fundamental to the music. **S O H N** has even been quoted as describing himself as an “old-school songwriter who happens to love electronic instruments”, it’s this marvel of bass music combined with more classical interpretations of pop that make his music so engaging. Much like **Gwilym Gold**, perhaps his closest contemporary, the electronic explorations never clouds the song writing, it instead rides soberly and somberly on the back of the mournful and well chosen words.\n\n**_“I’ve never been left alone, long enough, to be sure of where I’d go”_**\n\n**S O H** N’s debut 12″, _The Wheel, _will be out November 5th via **Aesop.**",
