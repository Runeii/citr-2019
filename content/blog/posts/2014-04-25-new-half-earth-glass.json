  "body": "Sheffield’s **The Half Earth** cropped up toward the latter stages of 2013, with his stunning track, Pale Water (since disappeared from the internet).\n\nWith a couple of high profile support slots under his belt, and a slot at Tramlines Festival coming up, Conor Stephenson takes his first step into 2014 with the stunning _Glass_. A slow burning number, building to an almost transcendental finale, it’s simultaneously fragile and resoundingly confident, part-MONEY, part Guillemots, not only does Stephenson carry one of the voices of the year, he knows how to utilise it. Based on the brief outing last year, and his latest venture, **The Half Earth **is onto something special. Check out _Glass_ below.",
