Fusing early 00’s dubstep influences with the modern R&B sound pioneered by the likes of **How To Dress Well**, it’s diverse and utterly beautiful. Whilst I perhaps jumped the gun by predicting that 2012 would be the year of **Noble Oak**, his material has certainly been deserving of a larger audience, hopefully 2013 will see more people opening their ears up to the young Canadian. Check out _Patience_ below.",
