  "title": "New: Hazel English – Fix",
  "date": "2015-09-28T17:15:21",
  "body": "An Australian singer/songwriter based in Oakland, California, Hazel English has been making the blogosphere swoon over the past six months with a series of tracks, beginning with ‘Never Going Home’, moving through to ‘It’s Not Real’, before arriving at her latest effort ‘Fix’.\n\nEmbossed with a heavy dose of reverb, English’s most recent musical offering moves in a haze of jangly indie pop. Calling out to the listener, ‘Fix’ is a very warming piece of music, wrapping itself around your mind in a sea of weaving guitar lines and rises of synths. While there aren’t any official release plans detailed as yet, Hazel English is definitely an artist to keep your eye on in the coming months.",
