  "body": "Having previously recorded under the moniker [Brightwood](https://www.facebook.com/brightwood/info), as part of a four piece, brothers Andrew and Stephen Brittell have decided to go their own way, and release music as **Land & Sea**. Their debut track _The Stand_ is a slick, indie-pop gem, complete with tinkling synths, decidedly perfect vocals and a overpowering sense of grandeur; it’s a track that feels like it’s made for the live circuit. Check out _The Stand_ below, and keep up with **Land & Sea** on Facebook.",
