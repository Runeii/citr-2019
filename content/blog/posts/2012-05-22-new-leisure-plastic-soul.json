With their debut album now almost two years in the making, they’ve finally set a release date of 18 June for the eight track release entitled _**Plastic Soul**_. This new cut and title track from the record is a wonderfully languid pop number, bewitchingly befitting to today’s glorious weather. **Leisure** wear their 60’s inspirations on their sleeves, whilst the vocals of lead singer **Jed Rouhana** have a to-die-for charisma not too dissimilar to **Pulp** frontman **Jarvis Cocker**. Check out _Plastic Soul_ below and head over to [their website](http://www.p-l-a-s-t-i-c-soul.com/) for more information.",
