  "body": "I’m a sucker for a sensual, seductive female vocal, and boy do Oregon’s **Flying Kites** have just that.\n\nThrow in a sparse, trip-hop influenced beat alongside an underlying classic pop nature and you’re on to a winner. These two new tracks from **Flying Kites** are far from the most complex works of art, but they’re delicately delectable and serve to lull the listener into a welcoming trance. The dubstep influence _Sundown_ is the more upbeat of the two tracks, sort of like a super minimal, far slicker **Little Boots** dancing to **Massive Attack** at an acid-fueled rave. On the flip-side _Mars_ is a more ethereal affair, allowing the vocals to take centre stage whilst the nearly invisible beat swirls majestically around the simplistic synths.\n\nCheck out _Sundown_ and _Mars_ below, and head over to the **Flying Kites** [soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/flying_kites) for some more tunes.\n\n [Sundown](http://soundcloud.com/flying_kites/sundown) by [Flying Kites](http://soundcloud.com/flying_kites)\n\n [Mars](http://soundcloud.com/flying_kites/mars) by [Flying Kites](http://soundcloud.com/flying_kites)",
