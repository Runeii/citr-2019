  "body": "**Wales** aka **Samuel Aaron Bennett** doesn’t have your stereotypical musical bio, especially not for a musician hailing from Brooklyn, the Mecca of new sounds.\n\nHaving been trained by the crew of Sesame Street (by crew I mean the production crew, not Big Bird, Elmo etc.) for a production role on PBS’s _It’s a Big Big World, _he’s aided with composing music for brands ranging from Facebook to CoverGirl. Having put out a [Bandcamp release](http://samuelaaronbennett.bandcamp.com/album/compositions-scores) of compositions and scores back in 2010, these two tracks are his first foray under the **Wales** moniker. Considered, elegant and bewitchingly inviting, lead track _Go_ is a blog-hit in waiting, whereas _Still Gone_, which featured on his previous release, is a more traditional acoustic number. Based on the strength of these tracks, perhaps it’s time for Bennett to focus on writing music for himself, as oppose to for films. Taste **Wales** below.",
