  "body": "So far this year we’ve seen people selling memory sticks, battered old unmarked CDs, cassette runs of 25 and of course, Mt.\n\nSi.’s corrupt hard drive containing hours of music, however Rhode Island’s **JD Holiday** have stepped it up a notch, selling their debut single, _Honeymoon_, on a 1.4mb floppy disk. Yep, a floppy disk. With Honeymoon supposedly being ‘Mixed and Mastered in a 1991 Chrysler LeBaron’, it’s clear that there’s a jovial, tongue in cheek element to JD Holiday, yet that doesn’t stop Honeymoon being pretty awesome. Think Real Estate, Wild Nothing etc, and you’re starting to think in the same sort of league; dreamy, laid back beach-pop. Check out Honeymoon below, and grab a floppy disk [here](http://jdholiday.bandcamp.com/).  \n<a href=\"http://jdholiday.bandcamp.com/album/honeymoon\">Honeymoon by JD Holiday</a>",
