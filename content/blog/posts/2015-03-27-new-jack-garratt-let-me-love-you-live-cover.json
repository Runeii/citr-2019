  "body": "One of my highlights of last weeks SXSW was finally getting to see **Jack Garratt** play, impressing a packed out, yet intimate Red Eyed Fly.\n\nWhilst out in Austin, Jack recorded a piano session for [BBC R1 / Huw Stephens](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02m9xt5), featuring a stunning rendition of Mario’s classic _Let Me Love You_, alongside previous single The Love You’re Given.
