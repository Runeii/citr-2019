  "body": "I’m almost ashamed that this is the first time South London dark-pop artist Halls has appeared on Crack in the Road, given his consistently high quality output.\n\nWith his debut LP **_Ark_** out 15 October on [No Pain In Pop](http://nopaininpop.tumblr.com/), the genius behind **Halls** aka **Sam Howard** has given the premiere of new track _Roses For The Dead_ to [Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14218-roses-for-the-dead/) (as you do). Wonderfully gloomy and startlingly intoxicating, it’s a sonic assault, recalling the downtrodden mist that hovered over the UK in the late 70s / early 80s. These are tense times, and **Halls** knows that all too well. Check out _Roses For The Dead_ below (stream via [The405](http://thefourohfive.com/news/article/halls-roses-for-the-dead-listen))\n\n  \n[Download Halls Roses for the Dead](http://soundowl.com/track/44d1/halls-roses-for-the-dead)",
