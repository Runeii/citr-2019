  "body": "With their debut track, [_Cry No More_](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/24066-new-vaults-cry-no-more/), tearing up Hype Machine charts and placing them as one of 2014’s most exciting prospects, London outfit **Vaults** dropped by Maida Vale to record a couple of tracks for Rob Da Bank. As well as playing the aforementioned Cry No More, they also debuted a new track in the form of Vultures. Continuing in their Ellie Goulding meets London Grammar vein, it’s powerfully evocative and a mightily promising sign for what is to come next year.",
