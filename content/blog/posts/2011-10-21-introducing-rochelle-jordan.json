  "body": "**Rochelle Jordan** is a breath of fresh air to the cramped world of female R’n’B artists.\n\nHer debut album _**R O J O**_ is set to change modern R’n’B in a way that **The Weeknd** could only have dreamed of, with the sassy yet sincere clarity each track is crafted with. From humble beginnings recording **Drake** covers in the confines of her bedroom, to unleashing a behemoth of a debut album at the end of August; Rochelle Jordan has already traveled a long way in such a short space of time. New cut _\\_Shot_ is a glowing, synth driven track, poignant and despairingly haunting. It’s wonderfully grounding yet heart-wrenching to hear **Rochelle’s** vivid story-telling; whilst at the same time forming a brilliant introduction for those who are still to hear **Rochelle’s** music.\n\nCheck out _\\_Shot_ below, and head over to **Rochelle’s** [bandcamp](http://rojoproto.bandcamp.com) for free downloads of all her material to date.",
