  "body": "For the past couple of weeks, I’ve had constant page suggestions to ‘like’ **Keyes** (Jade Keywood) on Facebook, despite her at the time having no music to her name, and only a handful of Facebook fans.\n\nSeeing her debut single drop via [P&P](http://pigeonsandplanes.com/2015/05/keyes-veins/) this afternoon, I had a sneaking suspicion that it would be pretty rad, and it definitely doesn’t disappoint. Sort of like a mix between Glasgow’s rapidly rising KLOE, Charli XCX’s debut album and Lorde, _Veins_ marks Keyes out as a talent to keep an eye on.\n\nFollow our [Spotify On Repeat playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a hand-picked selection of the current hottest tracks.",
