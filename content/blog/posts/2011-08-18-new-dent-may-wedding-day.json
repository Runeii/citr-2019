  "body": "Earlier today the new tune from [DENT MAY](http://www.dentmay.com/)‘s forthcoming 7″ on [PAW TRACKS](http://www.paw-tracks.com/) was released to stream online. The new track, _Wedding Day_, tells the story of a sister and her feelings towards her older sister’s wedding day; without meaning to sound lazy, the track is unashamedly feel good. Beautiful harmonies insist, “there’s a man on the way”, amongst an 80’s infused beat and whammy ridden guitar flourishes; it’s fun, catchy, and heartfelt pop music at its finest.\n\nStream the new track below.\n\n[Wedding Day](http://soundcloud.com/dentmay/wedding-day) by [Dent May](http://soundcloud.com/dentmay)",
