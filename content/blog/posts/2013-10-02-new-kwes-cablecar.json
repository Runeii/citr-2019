  "body": "**Kwes**’ full-length debut ‘_ilp_’ is due out October 15th via Warp, not long to go at all.\n\nI’ve got to say, it’s going to be satisfying to finally hear what a **Kwes** – full body of work – will sound like. It’s been a long time coming. After _36_, the album’s first leak, we now have _cablecar_ – a meandering, highly experimental odyssey of psychN’B. Which despite my best intentions is likely never to be a thing.\n\n_Cablecar_ is the bleakest **Kwes** track so far, each of the track’s many facets almost seem like punctuations to the drone like ambience that existed before and after the track’s 8 minute duration. It’s at times feverish, at others reluctantly optimistic – but it always hangs with a consuming level of fragility.\n\nHit play below.\n\n**_ilp_**** Tracklist:**\n\n01\\. purplehands  \n02\\. 36  \n03\\. rollerblades  \n04\\. cablecar  \n05\\. flower  \n06\\. hives  \n07\\. broke  \n08\\. chagall  \n09\\. parakeet  \n10\\. b\\_shf\\_l",
