  "body": "I’ve been keeping a close eye on **Oisima** for a while now, and this track reaffirms my belief that they are one of the hottest producers around at the moment.\n\nWith a debut EP in the works, **Oisima** has dropped a new cut in the form of the enthralling _Melting Paraiso_.

Anyway, enough talk, check out _Melting Paraiso_ below.\n\n [melting paraiso](http://soundcloud.com/oisima/melting-paraiso) by [Oisima](http://soundcloud.com/oisima)",
