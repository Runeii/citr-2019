  "body": "Edinburgh’s **EMILIE** (Emily Atkinson) showcases some of the tightest songwriting I’ve heard for a while on _Never Enough_, her first new material of 2017.\n\nWith a debut EP released last year, hinting at colossal potential, she’s already starting to come through on that early promise. Never Enough is a slick yet emotionally fraught number, placing itself amongst the likes of BROODS, CHVRCHES and St. Lucia, with it’s glossy production and EMILIE’s impeccable vocal. Never Enough is released 10 March 2017, check it out below.",
