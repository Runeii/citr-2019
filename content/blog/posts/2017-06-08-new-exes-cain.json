  "body": "**EXES** are brilliant at painting a picture with their songwriting, and sure, perhaps it’s slightly cliched at points, yet I’m still a sucker for it.\n\nLines like “_we were at the table listening to skinny love /and dancing ’til the sun came up_” almost end up feeling unnecessarily saccharine if it didn’t feel somehow relatable. Their latest track, _Cain_, perfectly encapsulates the sense of a relationship never fully embraced, and manages to make the fragility and devastation of it all sound beautiful.",
