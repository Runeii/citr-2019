  "body": "‘_The sound of the ocean makes you smile, while the smell of seaweed is on your mind_‘ and suddenly we’ve dived into the world of **Pacific Air**.\n\nHaving already drawn comparisons to **Passion Pit** (as well as earned themselves a support slot), the duo have racked up an impressive 20,000 plays of debut single _Float_ on their Soundcloud. The B-side to the track, _Roses_ is a tooth-rottingly sugary sweet pop number, like biting into a frosted donut and discovering it’s oozing with gorgeous strawberry jam… or something like that.",
