  "body": "Hailing from Vancouver, [**Buffalo Tide**](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Buffalo-Tide/104812832938745) aka **Christopher Oliver**, conjures up blissfully atmospheric electro-ambient soundscapes. With his forthcoming EP, entitled _**Arabia**_ set for release next month, we’re delighted to be able to premiere the lead track from it, in the form of the radiantly engrossing _Divine Lions_. **Buffalo Tide** perfectly captures a rare storytelling ability that is seemingly lost in a vast proportion of electronic based music, a trait that is utilized with great purpose on _Divine Lions_. Flowing seamlessly between dubstep influenced breakdowns and more striking, upbeat sections, it’s a track that requires and deserves full mental immersion.\n\nBuffalo Tide’s new EP _**Arabia**_ is out 11/11/11 through [BLBX](http://www.blbx.info/), hear some more of his stuff over at his [soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/buffalo-tide). Stream _Divine Lions_ below.\n\n Buffalo Tide – Divine Lions by [crackintheroad](http://soundcloud.com/crackintheroad)",
