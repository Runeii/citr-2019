  "date": "2012-07-31T19:14:09",
  "body": "Having [impressed with their demo’s](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14942-introducing-sweet-valley-slumber-party/) back in February, Orange County duo **Sweet Valley Slumber Party** have returned with a stirring new single, set to be the first release from their debut LP, out in August. _Virgins_ isn’t too much of a departure from their early work, yet certainly sees a progression in their songwriting, feeling far more fluid and considered, and worthy of being a single that gains them some much deserved coverage. Check out _Virgins_ below and keep your ears open for their debut album later in the year.",
