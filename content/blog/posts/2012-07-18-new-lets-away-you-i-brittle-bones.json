Built upon drunken romances, misleading glances and overpowering heartache, _You & I_ is a 60’s ballad in all it’s silky glory whilst the sombre _Brittle Bones_ dives into a sea of melancholy, fumbling for that final chance to reminisce and retrieve. Early days it may be, but these two tracks mark **Let’s Away** out as not just bright stars in the North East, but for the rest of the UK as well.",
