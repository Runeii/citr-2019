  "body": "So **Factory Floor** just casually blew my tiny mind.\n\nTheir new video looks like a PBS spot on Bill Cosby’s soul through the eyes of Kenneth Anger, but still riffing on that Neu!-via-New Order disco tip. These guys present themselves as ‘post-industrial’, which is an awfully glum way to go, but there’s more deadpan techno playfulness ahead by the looks of things. Knees crossed they keep the tempo at a set pace.\n\nHeck, I’m not gonna say much else cause the vid pretty much sums itself up. I must say though, dude is bustin’ some intense Carlton moves (braving seductive _and_ serious?). Which ever so slightly puts [these lil legs](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/12341-video-stray-kites-the-ghoster/) to shame…\n\n_Watch the video for Two Different Ways below._",
