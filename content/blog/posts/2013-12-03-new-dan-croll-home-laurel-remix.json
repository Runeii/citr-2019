  "body": "[Laurel](https://www.facebook.com/ClassicLaurel?fref=ts) extends her production skills from her own tracks to fellow Turn First artist [Dan Croll](https://www.facebook.com/dancroll?fref=ts)‘s new single ‘Home’. The result is a world away from the original, with Laurel turning the gentle folky number into a trip-hop dream. Pizzicato strings are teamed with soft synth sounds and a strong beat, with the result resembling the production work of Bonobo and Tourist.\n\nFollowing tracks like Firebreather and Blue Blood, young Laurel is proving herself as quite a talent.\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/122612806″ params=”color=ff6600&auto\\_play=false&show\\_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]",
