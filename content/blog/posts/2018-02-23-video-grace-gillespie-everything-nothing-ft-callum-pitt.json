  "date": "2018-02-23T13:41:09",
  "body": "Having spent much of last year touring as part of Pixx’s live band, London based **Grace Gillespie** is taking 2018 as her own.\n\nWith her debut demo, _Restoration_, receiving support from Newton Faulkner in Q Magazine, she’s now followed it up with her a live session of new track, _Everything (Nothing)_, calling in rising star Callum Pitt for assistance.\n\nThe melodies here are just sublime, sure to bring about comparisons to Marika Hackman’s debut LP, or the dreamier, more ethereal moments of Sharon Van Etten. There’s a real pensive confidence to the musicianship at the core of this, as the track beautifully unfurls, aided by Pitt’s subtle backing vocals. Check it out below and pre-save the [single here](http://presave.io/t/restoration).",
