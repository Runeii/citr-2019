  "body": "Fresh off the back of a host of packed out SXSW shows (including DN x CitR – thanks Mr SOHN), London via Vienna producer **SOHN** has announced his signing to legendary label 4AD, alongside releasing a video for recent track _Bloodflows_.\n\nDirected and filmed by Christian Pitschl in the Bavarian Alps and featuring actress Nadja Langer, it’s a fitting set of visuals for one of this years most beautiful songs. With rumours surrounding his label position for several months now, it’s fantastic to hear him finding a home with one of the most innovative labels around. Bloodflows is released as a 12″ in June, with an album expected sometime after that.",
