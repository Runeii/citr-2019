  "body": "It’s been a rollercoaster six months for **Savages**.\n\nSince forming in October last year, their terrifyingly intense live shows have caused quite a stir, despite the fact that as of this morning, they had no recorded material whatsoever to their name. Premiered via [Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/8837-savages/) earlier today, _Husbands_ is a perfect 70’s inspired number, three minutes in length and startlingly vivid, dominated by the snarling vocals of lead singer **Jehnny Beth**. Set to be the B-side to their forthcoming debut single _Flying to Berlin_ out 28 May, Savages have announced their arrival in the most thrilling way possible. Believe the hype. Check out _Husbands_ below and listened to our interview with the group [here](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/16514-interview-savages/).",
