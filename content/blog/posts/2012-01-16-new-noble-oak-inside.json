Having been following **Noble Oak** for a few months now, it’s fantastic to hear him maturing as an artist, and this track certainly marks a progression. This is music to truly lose yourself in, turn it up real loud and float away.\n\n [Inside](http://soundcloud.com/nobleoak/inside) by [Noble Oak](http://soundcloud.com/nobleoak)",
