The photographs exhibited are painfully realistic  shots of poignant contemporary issues, rigorously researched, that might have otherwise escaped our attention. From uncovering a lesser-known Amish community in Ireland, to delving into the psychology of musical tribute acts, all investigations are dealt with respect, tact and elegance.\n\n**Arvor** will be holding a summer festival to exhibit their work in Falmouth until the 23rd June.\n\nFor those who aren’t in the West Country, check out each photographers stunning portfolio on their website [HERE](http://arvor.weservesites.co.uk/).\n\n..and some examples below.\n\n#gallery-1 { margin: auto; } #gallery-1 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 25%; } #gallery-1 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-1 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } /\\* see gallery\\_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php \\*/\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Alexander-Walker-150x150.jpeg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22466-artist-profile-arvor/attachment/kosovo-forgotten-but-not-gone)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Amy-Whalley-150x150.jpeg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22466-artist-profile-arvor/attachment/amy-whalley)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Benjamin-Rutherford-150x150.jpeg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22466-artist-profile-arvor/attachment/benjamin-rutherford-documentary)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/India-Whiley-Morton-150x150.jpeg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22466-artist-profile-arvor/attachment/not-the-beatles)\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Mary-Robinson-150x150.jpeg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22466-artist-profile-arvor/attachment/5a)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Nia-Collier-150x150.jpeg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22466-artist-profile-arvor/attachment/village-life-a-portrait-of-stithians)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Rory-Matthews-150x150.jpeg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22466-artist-profile-arvor/attachment/rory-matthews)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Anders-Haugland-Pederson-150x150.jpeg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/22466-artist-profile-arvor/attachment/amish-mennonite-women-in-church)",
