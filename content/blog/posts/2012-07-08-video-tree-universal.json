  "body": "Released [earlier this year](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14795-new-tree-universal-ft-ariel-thiermann/), _Universal_ from SF psychedelic musician **Tree** now has an official music video to accompany it. One of the finest/weirdest tracks of 2012 so far, **Tree** has also announced his signing to R&S offshoot Apollo, with a collaboration with **Beat Culture** expected later this year. In true **Tree** style, the video is wonderfully trippy, taking the viewer on an acid driven experience; gloriously bizarre I’m sure you’ll agree. Check it out below.",
