  "body": "The prestigious _**Crack in the Road**_ **SOTW** award for this week goes to the brilliantly atmospheric _May I Walk With You_ by the UK’s very own **Star Slinger**.\n\nSince my discovery of his music I have been completely and utterly hooked, not only on his recent release _Volume 1_, but also on his many other tracks and remixes. Having remixed the likes of **Coolrunnings** and **Fiveng**, **Darren Williams** really showcases both his knowledge of excellent music, as well as his ability to produce innovative and stimulating songs.\n\n_May I Walk With You_ is the most recent offering from **Williams**, and again is a free download from his [bandcamp](http://starslingeruk.bandcamp.com/) site, showing his never ending generosity and belief in the freedom of accessibility of music. Featuring a sample of the **Life Without Buildings** track _The Leanover, May I Walk With You_ is a progressive and soulful experience, capturing the imagination and ears of the listener. An infectious hook repeats throughout the entire song, whilst the vocals complement the splendid beat; one of my tracks of the year so far.",
