  "date": "2012-02-07T21:04:51",
  "body": "Austin’s **Bug Machine**, the solo project (I assume) of the as yet unnamed man in the picture above, has a knack for writing insanely catchy synth-pop songs.\n\nHis debut EP **_Disconnect_**, available as a free download, is comprised of four dance-till-you-drop electronic numbers. With touches of a more upbeat, less stadium friendly **M83**, and even slight whiffs of Aphex Twin, the relentless _Heart Is On The Floor_ yearns to be played to packed, sweaty indie club. Elsewhere there’s the repetitive swing of _Sympathy_ and the infectious sample led bliss of _Slugs_, all complimented by **Bug Machine’s** soft, reassuring vocals.\n\nCheck out _Slugs_ and _Sympathy_ below, and head over to his [bandcamp](http://bugmachine.bandcamp.com/) for a full download.\n\n<a href=\"http://bugmachine.bandcamp.com/track/sympathy\">Sympathy by bug machine</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://bugmachine.bandcamp.com/track/slugs\">Slugs by bug machine</a>",
