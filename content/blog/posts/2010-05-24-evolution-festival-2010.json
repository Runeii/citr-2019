Although the line-up may not compete with the likes of **Reading/leads or Bestival**, this year’s set of artists more than warrants the price of admission. Highlights include the north east’s very own **The Futureheads** as well as **The Horrors**. Spanning two sites the festival undoubtedly offers something for even the most hardened music snob; us included. In the coming days **Crack in the Road** will be offering its top tips for the festival as this bank holiday weekend draws ever closer. Below is the festival’s full line-up to get you all excited, as well as a link to the festival’s lesser known event ‘**Evolution Emerging**’.
