  "body": "So when was the last time you saw two gorgeous and stylish twins singing their hearts out on stage?? Probably never unless you were at Concrete last night seeing the highly buzzed about dream-pop duo, **Say Lou Lou**.\n\nMy journey (read: obsession) with Miranda and Elektra Kilbey, aka Say Lou Lou, started with the release of their cover of Tame Impala’s track, Feels Like We Only Go Backwards. It is the embodiment of dream-pop and had me immediately googling everything about these mesmerizing chanteuses. I was pleased to discover last night that they are every bit as captivating in real life. Dressed in monochromatic pant suits all these two needed was slicked back hair and they could’ve easily been walking the runway for Céline—proving that you don’t have to show skin to be alluring. This confidence was carried out through the entirety of the performance. (obsession increasing)\n\nI didn’t recognize the opening song, but they played the complete range of previously released tracks–Fool of Me, Better In The Dark, Love Is The Loneliest Part, Julian, Feels Like We Only Go Backwards–and closed the show with the hauntingly beautiful track Maybe You. The standout here was Love Is The Loneliest Place most likely because its one of their oldest tracks. They sang it with such unity that for the first time in the show I could really see the connection that only twins are privileged with. Still get chills thinking of them singing the chorus. There’s absolutely no doubt that these girls sing with passion. I think what I admired most and what you’ll see in the photos is that Say Lou Lou are not afraid to forsake pretty and properly perform all of their tracks. No Lana Del Rey nonchalance here. Just raw committed singing.\n\nOverall these girls don’t need to be singing in basements. After last night’s performance its pretty damn obvious that they’re ready for big venues where their performance auras can properly shine. I think some of their fans last night would agree. _Never seen such vocal diehards like that before! _\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/112186330″ width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]\n\n#gallery-1 { margin: auto; } #gallery-1 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 100%; } #gallery-1 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-1 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } /\\* see gallery\\_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php \\*/\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_1343-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/24910-live-review-say-lou-lou-concrete-14th-nov/attachment/img_1343)\n\nSay Lou Lou at Concrete\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_1584-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/24910-live-review-say-lou-lou-concrete-14th-nov/attachment/img_1584)\n\nSay Lou Lou at Concrete\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_1581-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/24910-live-review-say-lou-lou-concrete-14th-nov/attachment/img_1581)\n\nSay Lou Lou at Concrete\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_1356-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/24910-live-review-say-lou-lou-concrete-14th-nov/attachment/img_1356)\n\nSay Lou Lou at Concrete\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_1504-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/24910-live-review-say-lou-lou-concrete-14th-nov/attachment/img_1504)\n\nSay Lou Lou at Concrete",
