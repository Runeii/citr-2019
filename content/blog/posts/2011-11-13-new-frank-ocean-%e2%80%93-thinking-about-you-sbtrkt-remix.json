  "body": "As 2011 slowly draws to a close, one thing becomes indisputably clear: this has without a doubt been ‘the year of **Frank Ocean**’.\n\nFrom the release of his debit Mixtape in February, to the slew of demos, guest appearances and remixes that followed, it’s abundantly clear that this has been a fantastic year for **Ocean**.\n\nThe track below, **[SBTRKT](http://soundcloud.com/sbtrkt)** re-edit of ‘**_Thinking About You_**’, is likely to be our last notable interaction with Ocean’s music before the year is out, but what a piece of music to end the year on. The track has largely been left in its original form, with **SBTRKT** gently interspersing the record with euphoric sounding synths and the mellowest of beats, it’s a great reinterpretation of the original.\n\nStream it below.",
