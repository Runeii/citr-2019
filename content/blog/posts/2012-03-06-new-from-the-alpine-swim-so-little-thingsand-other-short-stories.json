Yeah? YEAH?!\")f about this mercurial Brighton-based duo back in October of last year. **from the alpine, swim** have been somewhat quiet on the communications front since then, the [odd social media update](http://fromthealpineswim.tumblr.com/ \"There's a facebook as well. Find it yourself you lazy sod. \") our only portal into their otherwise hazy world. Until this evening, which has found two electrified, rhythm’d-up and wholly new tracks being uploaded to the band’s [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/fromthealpineswim \"Pssst...they're here. \"). Both _So Little Things_ and _And Other Short Stories_ temper their post-hardcore stylings with electronic beats and some by turns soulful and carnivalesque organ stabs. There are shades of La Dispute, Alexisonfire (pre-shite) and even Cursive in here, but still, what the finished product might sound like is enticingly obscured. Dripfeeding bastards.\n\n[Get ’em while they’re hot](http://soundcloud.com/fromthealpineswim \"Wait, did I do this already?\"). Oh yeah, you’ve only got ten minutes. Minus my writing time. So, ahhh…\n\nImage (c) Joel Wilson",
