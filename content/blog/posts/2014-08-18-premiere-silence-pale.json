  "body": "It’s been nearly 9 months since London’s minimalistic, synth-rock duo, Pale, released “Rundown” via their soundcloud.\n\nWith 160k plays Alan and Lee had their most successful single cementing their place –and aesthetic– in an ever-changing and ever-fickle music crowd. After their run of successful releases and an impressive performance at Sebright Arms (I had the pleasure of documenting for CITR [here](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/24807-review-pale-sebright-arms-oct-29)) the two unexpectedly faded softly from the scene just as quietly and effortlessly as their sound. Officially, the hiatus was to focus on writing, but I imagine it might have had more to do with Alan taking on a new role as [dad](http://instagram.com/p/labsffsv2e/?modal=true)! Whatever the reason Pale is thankfully back and releasing an EP appropriately titled “The Comeback EP” with previously unheard tracks “Comeback,” “New Man,” and “Silence.”\n\nPremiering here is their first release off the EP, “Silence”–a mellowly seductive track reminiscent of a grittier The XX.  “Turn me wild.”  “Show me where to get some ’til I get what I need”–Alan croons confidently over  moody ambient synths. _Its as if they never left._ Like all things _Pale, _its refined, sensual, brooding and utterly without pretense.",
