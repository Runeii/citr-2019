  "body": "It’s a testament to the strength of **Vallis Alps’** debut EP released back at the start of 2015, that aside from a single part-way through last year, it’s the only official material to their name.\n\nDespite having a literal handful of tracks out in the open, the duo have managed to play to packed out crowds across Australia and the USA whilst remaining fiercely independent. Now with a date set for the release of their follow up EP, Fable, at the end of March, they’ve released lead single, _East_. Taking a more obviously pop direction, the production and songwriting at the core of the track remains immaculate, and is sure to become a festival favourite. Check it out below.",
