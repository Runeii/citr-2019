The early promise of their debut releases has been refined, and transformed into a far bolder, more ambitious sound that they’re increasingly making their own. With their debut album just announced for early April time, plus UK shows over the next few months, their already devoted following is set to expand even further. Alongside news of their debut record, they’ve released a video for new single, _Orthodox Man,_ a live show favourite over the past year or so. _**That’s Your Lot**_ is out 7 April.",
