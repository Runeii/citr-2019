  "body": "Without realising it I’ve spent most of my day listening/watching this new cut from **Tawiah**, the South London artist who’s increasingly turning heads in the city.\n\nIt’s simple enough; heartfelt lyrics about a time once so good, that’s slowly drifted away, a video of her floating through water, it very easy to be cynical and it’s very easy to realise she’s got a lot of money behind her. But ultimately it hardly matters; _TEARdrop_ hits the spot within the parameters it sets out for itself.\n\n_FREEdom Drop_ will be released this spring.",
