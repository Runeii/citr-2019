I’m still obsessing over it three months later. I just think theres something particularly special about an artist that can still do inventive things in such a saturated music environment.\n\nDAVIDIAN makes music that would turn a basement of New Yorkers into a mess of undulating masses. I say that because I’ve seen it. Maybe its the throbbing bass? Maybe its the pulsating synth? Or maybe its the perfect amount of female vocals that turn an insane instrumental into ecstasy?
