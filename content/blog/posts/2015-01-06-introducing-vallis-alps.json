  "body": "Oh boy, what a way to start the year.\n\nThis EP from Canberra duo **Vallis Alps** is an absolute beauty. Parissa and David Ansari sum up everything that’s currently so great about the Australian electronic pop music scene; immaculate production, stunning songwriting and an otherworldly vocal. There’s elements of London Grammar, Lorde and even EDM influenced dance (Thru) across their debut self-titled EP, it’s refined, elegant and a truly magical listen. Check out _Young_, _Thru_ and _Reprieve_ below, and grab the full EP from [Bandcamp.](http://vallisalps.bandcamp.com/)",
