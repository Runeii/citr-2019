Slime)\") debut track, _Fresh Eyes_, made so much sense it was almost difficult to listen to. It was smooth as hell, dreamy and more than a little seedy at times. Nothing can be that smooth. Nothing. Well, **Bullion**, **Laura Groves** and Young Turks’ **Tic** are back, (this time without **slime**), and they’ve more than delivered on this ‘difficult second track’. The sound is more expansive, proving that sonically at least, the group have more than a little scope. Plus the violins at the end are to fucking die for.",
