  "body": "Oh Toronto you’re breaking my heart.\n\nAlongside Melbourne and Manchester, the Canadian city is one of the most exciting hotspots in the world for new music. Quartet **[HIGHS](http://highsmusic.tumblr.com/)** are just the latest in a long line of brilliant new acts hailing from Toronto to appear on _**CitR**_, with their vaguely Balearic, **Vampire Weekend** inspired pop. On their two debut tracks, _Summer Dress_ and _Nomads_ respectively, they’re found in a jovial mood, almost too upbeat for this god-awful dreary weather we’re experiencing at the moment.\n\nWith jangly **Foals** guitars and mixed female/male vocals, self-described as ‘inclusive and memorable’, **HIGHS** two demos are brimming with potential. With their debut EP on the way, here’s hoping they cement their place amidst the other acts that make Toronto such a fascinating city.",
