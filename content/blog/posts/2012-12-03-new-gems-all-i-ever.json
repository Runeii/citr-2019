  "body": "Since exploding onto the blogosphere with their fantastic debut track Void Moon, Washington DC based duo **GEMS** have already racked up several thousand plays on their soundcloud, alongside a barrage of praise.\n\nNew tune _All I Ever_ pits the minimal vibe of **The XX** against the sultry, dreamy atmosphere of **Beach House**, whilst maintaining the pop sensibilities found on _Void Moon_. With numerous ‘Ones to Watch in 2013’ lists cropping up around this time of year, you’d be naive to not consider **GEMS**.",
