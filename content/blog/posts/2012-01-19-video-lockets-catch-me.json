  "body": "You may remember **Lockets** from their debut track [_Camera Shy_](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13403-new-lockets-camera-shy/) unleashed onto the realms of the internet towards the tail end of last year. Well the Philadelphia duo are back for more, with the sumptuous _Catch Me_. Imagine an innocent, fledgling **My Bloody Valentine** jacked up on a whole Halloween’s worth of candy, and you begin to understand the general atmosphere of _Catch Me_. Synths swirl majestically whilst vocals from **Dani** float effortlessly over the top in such a youthful manner that it’s impossible to not be completely seduced. **Lockets** are truly blossoming into one of 2012’s finest new bands. Check out the video below, featuring footage from 1998’s _**Bullet Ballet**_ directed by **Shinya Tsukamoto** and starring **Kirina Mano**.\n\n[Lockets – Catch Me](http://vimeo.com/35126798) from [Lockets](http://vimeo.com/lockets) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
