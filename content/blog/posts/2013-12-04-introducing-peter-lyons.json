  "body": "Last week I had the pleasure of seeing Peter Lyons open for Rainer at Sebright Arms.\n\nInstant Love. He played quite a long set, but to date has only released one song and Soundcloud and iTunes. (Killing me Peter!) I forgive him though because Touch Me is one of the strongest first releases I’ve heard in months. On top of that its a brilliant cover of a rather euro-pop club hit from the early 2000’s. \\*shudders\\*\n\nDrawing visual and production inspiration from Rhye, Lyons ditches the falsetto creating an immediate warmth that puts you right into the middle of it all. An airy ambience starts the track like the apprehensive moments leading up to a first kiss. “Touch me in the mornin and last thing at night. Keep my body warm, you know it feels right”—Is he talking to me? I wish. When the tension of the strings breaks into bass at the 1:10 mark the clothes come off and the real fun begins. In hindsight it makes perfect sense that Lyons opened for Rainer seeing as both seem to be toying with subtle seduction and melodic moans.\n\n“Come a little closer,” he says. Don’t mind if I do.\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/113985739″ params=”color=ff6600&auto\\_play=false&show\\_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]\n\n[![IMG_2228](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_2228-640x426.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_2228.jpg) [![IMG_2230](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_2230-640x426.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_2230.jpg)\n\n(Some information has been found at [Dummy Mag](http://www.dummymag.com/videos/peter-lyons-touch-me))",
