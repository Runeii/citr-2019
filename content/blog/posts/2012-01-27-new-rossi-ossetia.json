  "body": "After returning from the rather fantastic **NARC/KYEO.**\n\n**tv** launch gig last night, I stumbled upon this gorgeous number from Nashville’s **Rossi**. However, having consumed several alcoholic beverages throughout the course of the evening, I decided it best not to attempt to extrapolate my intoxicated thoughts into coherent sentences. Upon waking up and listening to _Ossetia_ again, it proved to be the perfect morning after medicine, with it’s delicate vocals and simple yet effective instrumentation. Lyrically it hits the spot as well, telling a story of inner turmoil and longing for a sense of belonging; ‘With a love so fake, our hearts have gone to waste’. Check out _Ossetia_ below.\n\n<a href=\"http://rossi.bandcamp.com/track/ossetia\">Ossetia by Rossi</a>",
