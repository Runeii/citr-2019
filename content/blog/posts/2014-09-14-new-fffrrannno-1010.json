  "date": "2014-09-14T00:37:16",
  "body": "Can’t help but adore the way that FFFRRANNNO approaches music.\n\nFrom some of the best remixes of [The 1975](https://soundcloud.com/fffrrannno/me), to chopping up Lorde’s vocals, not forgetting his How To Dress Well satire, [How To Fuck Well](https://soundcloud.com/fffrrannno/how-to-fuck-well), he doesn’t take it half as seriously as the vast majority of young producers around right now, and is still several times as good. Latest outing, _1010_, finds him toying with Star Wars vocal samples, over a beat/synth-line combo that Jai Paul would probably want to nab for his elusive debut record (is it a Jai Paul sample?!). Check it out below, and keep your ears peeled for a record, [potentially](http://fffrrannno.tumblr.com/post/97273424332/stopped-doing-remixes-and-making-beats-got-boring) dropping next year.",
