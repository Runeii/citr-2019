  "body": "So after just one LP, [**Die Antwoord**’s](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/1857-who-the-fuck-are-die-antwoord/ \"Review: Who The Fuck Are Die Antwoord? – EP\") relationship with the record label **Interscope** is over. Earlier today the band released this statement.\n\n### So anyway… Interscope offered us a bunch of money again to release our new album TEN$ION.\n\n### But this time, they also tried to get involved with our music, to try and make us sound like everyone else out there at the moment.\n\n### So we said: ‘U know what, rather hang on to your money, buy yourself something nice…we gonna do our own thing. Bye bye’\n\nIt appears that **Die Antwoord** isn’t going to be toned down lightly. The 2 videos that followed the announcement cemented this even further, a cut called “_FOK JULLE NAAIERS_“, a track from their now self-released album _**TEN$ION**._ Stream the videos below and download the new track [here](http://zefshop.com/digital-products/die-antwoord-fok-julle-naaiers/).",
