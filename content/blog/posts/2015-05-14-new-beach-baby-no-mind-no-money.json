  "date": "2015-05-14T10:00:28",
  "body": "Following on from their superb debut effort ‘Ladybird’, London four-piece Beach Baby return with the AA side to their debut single, entitled ‘No Mind No Money’.\n\nPicking up on the post-punk and 80’s New Wave feelings of ‘Ladybird’, the band’s latest output is a calmer affair as the track rests of a bed of harmonic guitar riffs and woozy melodies. While ‘No Mind No Money’ operates on a hazier level than it’s predecessor, it is as infectious and marks a further evolution in the band’s very promising sound. Beach Baby may well just soundtrack your summer.",
