  "body": "The title of Toronto resident Thomas Mazurkiewicz’s debut E.\n\nP, under the moniker **Home Alone,**  goes a long way in describing the musical territory that he and other young ‘bedroom’ artists seem to be fond of occupying**.** **_Teddybears and Weed_** is an amusingly neat summation of a brand of wide-eyed, synth and guitar production that sounds born out of introspection, feeling like a kid, and faced with the worrying prospect of having to pretend to be a real, grown up person. As the title suggests, everything on here feels a little hazy – the reverb-drenched vocals on songs like _Wishful Sinking_ and title track _Teddybears and Weed_ are thrown far back into the mix, making it hard to decipher more than the odd lyric. Even so, every little detail feels nicely measured – the guitar on _Sleep.Walk.In_ is simple and unchanging  but keeps the song moving perfectly all the way through.\n\nGiven Trevor Powers’  recent  meteoric rise, comparisons with [**Youth Lagoon**](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/19672-new-youth-lagoon-mute/ \"Youth Lagoon - Mute\") feel somewhat unavoidable – by no means a bad thing. But with this seven track E.P. (available for free download on bandcamp – see below) Mazurkiewicz offers up a lovely and languid set of songs that are accomplished to the point of making any worries about familiar territory seem fairly irrelevant.  It’s a less anxious collection than something like **_The Year of Hibernation_** or **Arrange’s** _**[Plantation](http://arrange.bandcamp.com/album/plantation \"Arrange - Plantation on bandcamp\")** ­_– Mazurkiewicz solution to worrying about things seems to be, according to his bandcamp, the fairly simple combination of the “Music I make, Blunts I Smoke.” It seems to work for him. \n\n<a href=\"http://myhomealone.bandcamp.com/album/teddybears-weed\">Teddybears &amp; Weed by Home Alone</a>",
