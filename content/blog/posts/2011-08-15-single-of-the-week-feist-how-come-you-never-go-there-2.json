  "title": "Single Of The Week: Feist – How Come You Never Go There",
  "date": "2011-08-15T23:43:42",
  "body": "The first single to be dropped from **Feist**’s new album, **_Metals_**, is an understated, reclusive, yet ultimately inspiring little number.\n\nIt all centers around a simple question, “_How come you never go there_?” and in truth it’s all the song needs. **Feist**’s simple yet elegant voice inspires so much back-story, so much human longing, that any lavish production would ultimately seem unnecessary. The tune plods along to a steady beat, at times it flourishes with hope; broken and brittle guitar interludes almost foolishly reach past this broken romance. But, as these stories so often conclude, the questions are left unanswered; it’s a stark simple and ultimately bold return to form.\n\n**_Metals_** is released on October 4 on [Cherrytree](http://www.cherrytreerecords.com/)/[Interscope](http://www.interscope.com/) in the U.S., October 3 in the UK via [Polydor](http://www.polydor.co.uk/) and October 4 in Canada via [Arts&Crafts](http://www.arts-crafts.ca/).\n\n[How Come You Never Go There](http://soundcloud.com/feist-1/how-come-you-never-go-there-2) by [Feist](http://soundcloud.com/feist-1)",
