  "body": "A while back, hotly-tipped Mancunian DJ and producer **xxxy** was been given the task of remixing **Ghostpoet**‘s dope-rap-track ‘**Liiines**‘, adding another notch to his ever-increasing tally of remixes.\n\nExamples being reworks of **Radiohead** and **Alpines** tracks.\n\nThe song itself has just landed on **SoundCloud** and doesn’t stray too far from the original recording, building up nicely through a pounding off-beat, coupled with a looped vocal and what sounds like the odd striking of a woodblock. Then, right on time, the verse drops into a snare-laden funky house bassline which pogos the song into life, creating an interesting contrast with Ghostpoet’s often slurred vocals. ‘**Liiines**‘ has also been given a rework by glitch-house daddy **Lando Kal**.\n\n‘**Liiines**‘ and its remixes are set for release on **September 5th** on **Brownswood Recordings**. Listen to ‘**xxxy**‘s take on the track below.\n\n [Ghostpoet – Liiines (xxxy Remix)](http://soundcloud.com/ghostpoet/ghostpoet-liiines-xxxy-remix) by [ghostpoet](http://soundcloud.com/ghostpoet)",
