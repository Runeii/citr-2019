Well it would appear that turning beautiful indie numbers into dance anthems is catching, as UK outfit **Ecstasy** try their hand at **Band Of Horses** _The Funeral_. I’ll admit to having a slight bias here, as the original happens to be one of my favourite compositions ever, however they don’t do too lousy a job in truth. So it lacks the poignantly strained vocals and subtely, but as with _Perth_, it’s an enjoyable enough a listen, replacing the gentle guitars with booming synths. Check out _The Funeral_ below.",
