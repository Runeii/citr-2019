  "body": "Self-described as “shoe-gaze guitars and post-punk vibes, mixed with a disco love for ghost house and electronica”, it’s fair to say that UK four piece [**Lame Deer**](https://www.facebook.com/TheLameDeer) possess an eclectic range of influences. Signalling out two of my favourite artists as inspirations in the form of **Joy Division** and **My Bloody Valentine**, it would be all to easy for me to get on my high horse and be overtly critical, or even write them off as mere wannabes, yet in truth, **Lame Deer** have something rather special going on.\n\nOn their newly released five track EP entitled _**Disguise**_, they tear through pioneered sounds of the aforementioned artists in visionary style, swinging from the sublime _The White Tiger_ to the more reserved, thrillingly addictive _Cheap Hollywood_. Whilst the rest of the UK indie scene appear content with sidling nonchalantly down the middle of the road, **Lame Deer** deconstruct and rebuild their own sound with apparent ease.\n\nAlmost impossible to pin down, the likes of _Cheap Hollywood_ traverse the boundaries of **Queens of the Stoneage**\\-esque riffs and muddled shoegaze walls of sound. At the epicentre of **Lame Deer** is a stellar, no frills attached songwriting ability, whether it’s the **Gorillaz** vocals of _The White Tiger_ or the emotional wreck of _Good Shoes. Cold Night_, the founding pillar is years of experience and a lack of inhibition. Stream my personal highlights below, and grab the full _**Disguise**_ EP from their [bandcamp](http://thelamedeer.bandcamp.com/) on a pay what you like basis.\n\n<a href=\"http://thelamedeer.bandcamp.com/track/good-shoes-cold-night\">Good Shoes.
