  "body": "Greek indie pop duo [**Plastic Flowers**](https://www.</p><p>facebook.com/PlasticFlowers) just released their rather fantastic new single **Summertime Pop** ahead of their debut full length release which will drop on March 3.

Stream it below and stay tuned for [**Evergreen LP**](http://www.inner-ear.gr/gr/releases/artist/70-plastic-flowers/108-evergreen/) set to drop via **Crash Symbols** and [**Inner Ear**](http://www.inner-ear.gr/gr/releases/artist/70-plastic-flowers/108-evergreen/) which also includes contributions from **Keep Shelly In Athens** and **Ed Askew**.  \n\\[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/137007280″ params=”auto\\_play=false&hide\\_related=false&visual=true” width=”100%” height=”450″ iframe=”true” /\\]",
