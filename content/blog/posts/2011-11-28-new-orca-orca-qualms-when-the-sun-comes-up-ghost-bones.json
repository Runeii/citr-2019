  "body": "Split releases can be rather self-indulgent at times, especially when acts simply stick a couple of previously heard tracks onto a vinyl alongside efforts from one of their friends.\n\nLuckily, with this new release from **Orca Orca** & **QUALMS**, that’s certainly not the case. Having ‘introduced’ **Orca Orca** a couple of months back, it’s great to hear some new material from **Jim Hewitt**, in the form of the angelic _When The Sun Comes Up_.\n\nProduction wise, it’s lo-fi at it’s purest, almost like a more pop-orientated **Wavves**, with the an extra guitar section from **QUALMS** adding another dimension to the track. On the flip side, _Ghost Bones_ is a more electronically induced affair, but maintaining the underlying pop tendencies. Check out both tracks below.\n\n<a href=\"http://orca-orca.bandcamp.com/album/orca-orca-qualms-split-7\">Orca Orca / QUALMS &#8211; Split 7&quot; by orca orca</a>",
