  "body": "Pop-Electronica trio Mr Sanka return with new uplifting anthem _Be Easy_.\n\n The band have chosen to give more breathing space and depth to Be Easy as opposed to the more care free and bouncy feel of their previous hit Flight Mode. The song opens with seemingly dour synth patches and handclap percussion supporting the vocals and lyrics discussion of trying to keep positive in tough times. As the booming drum machine kick in the layered vocals start to brighten the tone of the song building the verse up towards a euphoric chorus. The tension of the verse and the release of the chorus keeps Be Easy incredibly refreshing and creates the “light at the end of the tunnel” optimism of the track. Check out the bands fun animated video below.",
