Having released a trio of tracks back in 2011, **Iris** are back with a bundle of new material. Poignantly simplistic numbers, _Good Stuff_, _Sleep_ and _Kissing The Habit_ aren’t breaking down musical barriers, but for what they are, they’re rather stunning. EP highlight, the grungy _Kissing The Habit_ finds Malley’s vocals duelling exquisitely with the atmospheric guitar playing of Moreno. Check out all three of the tracks below, and keep up with the duo on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/weareiris).",
