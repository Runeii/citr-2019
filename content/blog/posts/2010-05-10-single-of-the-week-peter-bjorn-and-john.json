And so we did, and might I say It created something rather beautiful. This week’s single of the week is _Amsterdam_ by the frankly wonderful **Peter Bjorn and John**. Breezy, laid back and oddly grove filled; this is the tune you need to live your week by.\n\n[Check The Myspace](http://www.peterbjornandjohn.com/)\n\n[Download Peter – Bjorn & John ft Spec Boogie- Amsterdam (Loosie remix)](http://goldengazelle.com/Brig/peter%20bjorn%20and%20john%20and%20SPEC%20BOOGIE-amsterdam.mp3)",
