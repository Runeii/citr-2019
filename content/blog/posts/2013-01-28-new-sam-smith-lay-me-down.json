  "body": "Having provided guest vocals for **Disclosure’s** 2012 hit _Latch_, **Sam Smith** has called in a favour from the duo, having them produce his newest track _Lay Me Down_.\n\nWhilst I wasn’t overly keen on the dross-house vibe to Latch, this new track shows **Smith’s** vocal range is truly worth getting excited about. Far more soulful, and dare I say it innovative than the likes of Tom Odell, Lay Me Down is both understated and fantastically over-the-top (‘_you told me not to cry when you were gone_‘). In truth, it’s far closer to **Boyz II Men** than it is to the house-pop of Disclosure.",
