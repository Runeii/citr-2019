G. Cook**, and apparently through XL Recordings (produced by Diplo…?), it’s surfaced online as part of their Boilerroom set earlier this week. A nine minute long mindfuck with a four minute spoken word intro, it’s unlike anything you’ve ever heard before, and that’s a guarantee. Skip to 4.30 to hear the song itself, or if you’ve got the time, bask in the genius of the entire composition.",
