  "body": "**Solar Year** hold a special place in my heart, as being the first act that I saw at SXSW.\n\nJust as the festival was beginning to kick into gear on Tuesday afternoon, walking into a dimly lit converted garage to be greeted by the immersive, enigmatic sounds of the Canadian duo was a rather memorable manner in which to start an unforgettable week. Of their glitchy, sagacious set, one track in particular caught my attention; the remarkably peerless _Seeing The Same_. Handsome vocal sections echo with a heavenly resonance, building to each swirling, pinacle. Quite truly a masterpiece of a track.",
