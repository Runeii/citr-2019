  "title": "New: Mom Tudie Feat. Giorgia Lo – Nothing More To Say",
  "date": "2014-11-14T13:03:26",
  "body": "It’s been a little while since we’ve heard from up and coming London producer Mom Tudie, however he has returned today with another sublime cut featuring Giorgia Lo, entitled ‘Nothing More To Say’.\n\nImmediately engulfing the listening with his trademark smooth percussion and soulful transitions, ‘Nothing More To Say’ is galvanised by the warming sounds of a soaring trumpet line, matching the absorbing vocals of Giorgia Lo and her lyrical narrative. It is Tudie’s clever and acutely contemporary production style that stands out in the track, referencing sounds of jazz and RnB while remaining entirely forward thinking in his sonic outlay.\n\nWe can’t wait to hear more from Mom Tudie, though in the meantime you can listen to ‘Nothing More To Say’ below.",
