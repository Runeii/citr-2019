The tunes were short, incessantly blissful and managed transport listeners to tropical shores regardless of the weather in their general radius. _Crystal Ball_ does this and more; it’s groove soaked and hazy, laid back but never boring, ultimately it’s like nothing released so far this summer.\n\nStream and download the album below.\n\n<a href=\"http://monsterrally.bandcamp.com/album/crystal-ball\">Crystal Ball by Monster Rally</a>",
