  "body": "In the first of a few posts concerning ‘bands what I saw at The Great Escape last weekend’, here’s _Repent and Rebuild_ from Midlands-based, non-religious noisemongers **†HYMNS†**, lifted from last year’s debut **_Cardinal Sins/Contrary Virtues_**.\n\nHymns have grown from a duo into a four-piece since their inception, and based on the state of my ears (not to mention my armpits) after their set at the Pav Tav last friday, they’re making an even more unholy racket into the bargain, howling real or imagined crises of faith over Pixies-informed guitar attack. At the base of it, it’s just really nice to see the irrepressible Sam Manville throwing himself and his guitar around a stage again.\n\nYou can find _**Cardinal Sins/Contrary Virtues**_ over at the Big Scary Monsters [bandcamp](http://bsmrocks.bandcamp.com/album/cardinal-sins-contrary-virtues \"I wanted to link to the Function one...\") for a paltry 5 quid. Say [three](http://hymns.bandcamp.com/ \"Bible\") [Hail](https://www.facebook.com/prayforhymns \"Scapula.\") [Marys](http://prayforhymns.tumblr.com/ \"Hymn book. \"). Amen.",
