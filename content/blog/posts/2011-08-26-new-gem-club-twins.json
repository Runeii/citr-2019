The first release from the album, also named **_Breakers_**, was a heart-wrenching piano driven lullaby, which glided and shuffled around the heart before finally breaking it. The follow up mp3, _**Twins**_, follows in a similar vein. Piano driven from the very beginning, it opens with the line “the wind shook the kiss from your mouth”, a trembling and heartbreaking entry to the world. What follows is some of the most sensitive and delicate orchestration I’ve heard in a while.\n\nStream **_Twins_** and watch the new video for **_Breakers_** below.",
