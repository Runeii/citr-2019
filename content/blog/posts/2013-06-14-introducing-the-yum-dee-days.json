There’s the lullaby swing of _The Future Is A Drag_, complete with lighters in the air chorus, ready made for festival circuits, coupled with the hazy, too cool for school chime of the Strokes-esque _Out 4 Daze_. I can already sense that I won’t be the last person to pen my thoughts on **The Yum Dee Days**. Check out The Future Is A Drag below, and if that floats your boat, then stream the full LP below.",
