  "body": "**Callum Pitt** has had a pretty decent year so far, with his first two tracks gaining serious online traction amongst tastemakers whilst clocking up half a million streams on Spotify.\n\nSongwriting wise, elements of The War On Drugs and Fleet Foxes seep in to his compositions yet tinged with a more accessible edge. Recent single, _Rabbits_ is another example of his stellar writing; atmospheric and anthemic, it’s another bold step forward for him. Check it out below.",
