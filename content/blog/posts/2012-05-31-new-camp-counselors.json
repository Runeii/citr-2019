  "title": "New: Camp Counselors – Roman Blankets / City Streets",
  "date": "2012-05-31T02:25:20",
  "body": "So as with many of the artists I write about, I have no clue whatsoever who the musician(s) behind Buffalo’s **Camp Counselors** are, all I know is that their two debut tracks are pretty special.\n\nLo-fi synth led numbers, the five and a half minute epic that is _Roman Blankets_ is remorseful, overflowing with longing and youthful lust whilst _City Streets_ is a more 80’s darkwave inspired track, with a far more defined chorus. If I had to hazard a guess, I’d say **Camp Counselors** is a solo-outfit, most noticeably in the electronic percussion sections, however I could well be wrong, either way, they’re two thoroughly fantastic tracks. Check out both tracks below and grab a free download if it’s your sort of thing.\n\n<a href=\"http://campcounselors.bandcamp.com/album/roman-blankets-city-streets\">ROMAN BLANKETS/CITY STREETS by CAMP COUNSELORS</a>",
