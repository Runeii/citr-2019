  "body": "As much as you’d think that with the colossal amount of music I write about, or even listen to, that I might forgot 99% of it within a matter of days, I’m actually very much at the opposite end of the spectrum.\n\nJapanese teenage bedroom sensation **Left Right Arms** first appeared back in [September last year](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/17844-introducing-left-right-arms/), and just this evening has released his debut EP, the refined _**A Sleep**_. Delicate and timid, there’s a stellar songwriting capability expressed, verging into pop territory (_Twelve Oaks_), not mention the sublime, singalong chorus of _Ascend Soon_.\n\nFor an artist with little to no online presence, no visible identity and only a handful of tracks to his name **[Left Right Arms](http://www.facebook.com/LeftRightArms)** makes one hell of an impact. Minimal yet intensely thought-provoking, it’s refreshing to hear a young artist that truly values substance over style. Check out the full EP below, and grab it at a pay-what-you-like deal.",
