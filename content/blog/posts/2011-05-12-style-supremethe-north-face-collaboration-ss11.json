  "body": "The collaboration between **The North Face** and **Supreme** is getting another run over at **[The Hideout](http://hideoutstore.com/)** from the 14th of May. The collection features 3 choices of jacket, a range of hats and a set of sleeping bags. The two iconic brands sit side by side on the jacket’s shoulders, with the garment itself being a pullover in style. The caps aren’t to my taste, but the jackets and sleeping bags definitely find a way of blending the 2 ideologies the 2 brands stand for. The jackets come in 3 colours and are perfect for festival season. Be sure to head down to the store on Saturday.",
