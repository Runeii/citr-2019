  "body": "Describing his style as “ramshackle”, Manchester based electronic artist Cameron Crook put a new song up on his Soundcloud an hour ago.\n\nYou is dark and droning, somewhat reminiscent of Four Tet and Boards of Canada. In classic Crook style the track is driven by echoed samples and spatial beats.\n\nLet this one wash over you like a lightning storm on a summer evening.\n\nYou can find Cameron’s latest four track EP over on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/cmrntcrk \"Cameron Crook's Soundcloud\") or download a track from his 2011 album The Nettle Patch, [here](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/9777-introducing-mpfree-cameron-crook/).\n\nphoto credit: [Roozbeh Rokni](http://www.flickr.com/photos/roozbeh11/3806951134/) via [photopin](http://photopin.com) [cc](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/)",
