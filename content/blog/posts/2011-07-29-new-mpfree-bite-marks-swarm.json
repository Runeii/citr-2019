Hell, even I’ve been known to have an occasional jam session now and then. So it’s no surprise that amongst the scores of bedroom producers, it takes a truly inspired moment to leap out from the crowd, and this is exactly what this track from BITE MARKS does. Opening with a rather overly repetitive sample, it’s not until the languid vocals enter that the track begins to lurch elegantly into life.\n\nThe lo-fi undertones are strikingly coherent and effective, as the track twists between muffled vocals and violin like samples. There’s touches of Purity Ring and Waskerley Way on SWARM, yet there’s a feeling that BITE MARKS aims to mould a sound entirely their own, and which will hopefully be found on future tracks. Thanks to [lost lost lost](http://www.lostlostlost.com/2011/07/bite-marks-swarm.html) for the heads up!\n\n[BITE MARKS – SWARM](http://soundcloud.com/lost-lost-lost/bite-marks-swarm) by [Lost Lost Lost](http://soundcloud.com/lost-lost-lost)",
