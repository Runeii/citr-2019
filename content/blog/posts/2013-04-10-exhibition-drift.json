Having devoted 3 hours of my time drawing screaming kids as part of the Childrens Literature Festival, I resided to the gallery upstairs of the National Museum of Wales to find some solitude.\n\nThe exhibition shows three films: ‘Drift’, ‘Frari’ and ‘Cappricci’. ‘Drift’ was a piece in response from the commission by the Arts Council to represent Wales in the Venice Biennale in 2011. He stated he felt like previous artists felt so much prestige of the city and event, that people were not noticing the city itself.\n\n‘Drift’ shows a beautifully shot journey of Venice on water, where his hand caresses the surface, ‘manipulating the architecture of the city’ through the reflection. ‘Frari’ shows a more emotional response to the city, depicting the experience of locking himself in a bell tower that he bagged the keys to.\n\nThe illegible and erratically paced imagery, combined with congested sounds of the city makes you wonder what the hell happened in that tower. Bleached out stills and moving imagery that echo what might just be ‘life flashing before your eyes’, paints an entirely different picture of Venice.\n\nThe exhibition continues until the 26th of May in the National Museum of Wales.
