  "body": "httpv://www.\n\nyoutube.com/watch?v=ekFWPsXXcg0&feature=youtu.be\n\nThe new video from John Grant, whose album _Pale Green Ghosts_ is currently making waves, is definitely worth five minutes of your time. While ‘GMF’ is a maudlin, folk-y pop song, the video finds the singer/songwriter in a far more jovial mood. The premise of the piece revolves around following the artist while he is going about his daily routine, which includes activities such as playing basketball, visiting a pet shop and throwing some shapes on a night out. The whole thing is good fun and was directed with some serious swagger by Lucy Luscombe. _Pale Green Ghosts_ is out now on Bella Union.",
