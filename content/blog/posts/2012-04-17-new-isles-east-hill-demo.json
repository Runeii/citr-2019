  "body": "Yet another track from Pensacola’s **Isles** clearly marked as ‘DEMO’, portraying how keen the group are to not be judged on their production values, and instead on their songwriting abilities.\n\nNew track _East Hill_ is a dreamy number, utilizing rippling guitar lines and reverb-drenched vocals to splendid effect. Whilst it’s still early in **Isles’s** career, it’s surely only a matter of time before they begin causing serious waves. Check out _East Hill_ below.",
