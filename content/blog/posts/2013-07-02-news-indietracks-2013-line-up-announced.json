  "body": "Whilst the world’s eyes were on Glastonbury this weekend, the final line-up for the seventh super-twee Indietracks festival was unveiled.\n\nTaking place in the depths of the Derbyshire countryside, Indietracks 2013 includes [Camera Obscura](http://www.camera-obscura.net/), [The Wave Pictures](http://www.thewavepictures.com/) and Emma Kupa of [Standard Fare](http://www.standardfare.co.uk/) fame. Two Glasweigan legends, [The Pastels](http://www.dominorecordco.com/artists/the-pastels/) and The Wake (so indie they’re not even online) are also going to be playing.\n\nCheck out the outdoor stage line-up below and find the full listings for the festival’s four stages [here](http://www.indietracks.co.uk/schedule.html \"Indie Tracks Line-up\").\n\n![Indietracks 2013 ](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/lineup-indie-festival.png)\n\nIndietracks always receives [rave reviews](http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4145207) but be prepared to be surrounded by flannel shirts and real ale, this festival is the epitome of twee. Taking place at the Midland Railway in Ripley, festival goers get unlimited rides on the steam railway for the whole weekend.\n\nThere’s also a whole workshop entitled _‘How to create iconic indiepop album covers in Lego’_ … I’m not kidding. Rock and fucking roll!\n\nTickets are priced at £72 for the weekend and available over at the official [Indietracks website](http://www.indietracks.co.uk/tickets.html \"Indietracks\").",
