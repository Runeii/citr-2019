His two debut demos, _Biggest Love_ and _Refugee_, are out and out pop numbers that, with slightly cleaner production, could easily make a run for the charts, yet all that said, I’m still on the fence about ZEE, and if anything, it’s the touches of **Pet Shop Boys** that make me believe that there’s something here.",
