  "body": "Wasn’t completely sold on **Boots’** debut mixtape, Winter Spring Summer Fall, despite having moments, it felt a little cloudy, and in truth at times a little directionless.\n\nHowever, newest track, _Mercy_ is his best solo material released to date, toeing the line between full on Youth Lagoon-esque ballad and uber-cool How To Dress Well electronic odd-pop, by passing Muse on the way. Not only is the song itself fantastic, the video also finds him stepping out from behind the veil and showing his face, albeit a rather beaten up one. Check out the video below (remind anyone else of [Francis Lung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eszlVxPkNv4)?)",
