  "date": "2014-09-03T14:01:44",
  "body": "Earlier this year, London outfit **The Night VI** wowed with a cover of Frank Ocean’s [Thinking About You](https://soundcloud.</p><p>com/thenightvi/thinkin-bout-you-o-frank), and now the six piece are back with another sumptuous offering; their take on _Drops_, a highlight of Jungle’s recently released debut LP. Recorded live for [Naked Noise](http://nakednoise.co.uk/), it captures the essence of the elegance and composure with which The Night VI hold themselves, bringing their exquisite vocals to the forefront. As with their Frank Ocean cover, they make the cover entirely their own, through an ethos summed up by guitarist Jack Gourlay as “we simply listened to it as if it was ours and simply thought ‘how would we of done this?'”. Check out Drops below, and expect an announcement regarding their second EP in the near future.",
