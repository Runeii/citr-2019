  "body": "With Lana Del Rey’s debut album out in just over two months, a new cut set to feature on the release has ‘leaked’ from **Born To Die**.\n\n_Off To The Races_ has appeared in various bootleg/demo forms before but this is the first studio version of the track. As in previous cuts, **Del Rey** plays heavily to her sultry vocal strengths and the excellent production values on the track, combining pop and R’n’B influences to create a sugary sweet behemoth of a tune. In typical Lana style, it’s fairly cliched lyrically, but somehow, it’s wonderfully addictive. Check out _Off To The Races_ below, and a picture of **Llama Del Rey**.\n\nLana’s management obviously decided that us letting you hear the track wasn’t a good promotional move, and forced us to remove it from soundcloud, check out Off To The Races via Youtube below.\n\n  \n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/391994_10150633836154768_540819767_11980176_1739159379_n.jpg \"Llama Del Rey\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13279-new-lana-del-rey-off-to-the-races/attachment/391994_10150633836154768_540819767_11980176_1739159379_n/)",
