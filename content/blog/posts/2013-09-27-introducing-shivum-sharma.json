  "body": "At just eighteen years old, **Shivum Sharma** is the latest London teenager set to make a name for himself, joining the likes of Chloe Howl, King Krule and Jamie Isaac.\n\nMusically, there’s hints of Isaac in the sparse, piano driven minimalism in **Sharma’s** music, that slowly evolve into uplifting masterpieces, not too dissimilar to Antony and the Johnsons. Recent track _Flicker_ also draws from James Blake’s debut LP, as well as the likes of Perfume Genius and How To Dress Well. Check out a few of his tracks below, and keep up with **Shivum** over at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/shivumsharmamusic).",
