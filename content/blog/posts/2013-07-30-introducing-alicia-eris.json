To be honest, I’d probably argue against that, but that’s not to say that it’s not absolutely brilliant pop. Eris’s debut single under her new moniker is a soulful, hip-hop inspired number, yet relying upon it’s the slick, upbeat chorus, not too dissimilar to rising star Lolo. Reportedly working with Syd The Kid from Odd Future, **Alicia Eris** is a name to keep an eye out for. Check out _I Moved On_ below.",
