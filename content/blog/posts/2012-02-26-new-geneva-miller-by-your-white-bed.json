  "date": "2012-02-26T13:09:06",
  "body": "After releasing her debut track, [_The Apple Tree_](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14878-new-geneva-miller-the-apple-tree/), earlier this month, Corona’s dreamfolk singer **Geneva Miller** has followed it up with a more cautious, melancholic number. Centered around a gently picked guitar and the soothing vocals of Miller, there are moments in the production on By Your White Bed that could be deemed slightly weak, yet not frequent enough to render the track unlistenable. All in all, it’s another very promising release, check it out below.",
