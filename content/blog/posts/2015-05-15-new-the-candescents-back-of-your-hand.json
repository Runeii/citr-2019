  "body": "By the looks of **The Candescents** shows, they’re pretty into the house party scene.\n\nTheir snarling debut single, _Back of Your Hand_ is immensely memorable for what it is; 2 minutes of Arctic Monkeys and The Vines indebted garage rock, self described as ‘rock music that’ll drive yo momma nuts’. Judging a band on two minutes of music is pretty dangerous, but there’s definitely something rather exciting about the Columbus quartet.\n\nFollow our [Spotify On Repeat playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a selection of the current hottest tracks.",
