  "body": "Spending two weeks in sunny Spain made me realise just how much of a let-down the UK ‘summer’ months have been.\n\nSo with that in mind, let me introduce you to an ode to ‘the summer that never was’, and a track that’s fully deserving of being a festival anthem at some point in the near future. **Parlours**, a dream-pop five piece hailing from Des Moines just released their new album **_All Is Here_**, and _Dreamers_ is one of the standout tracks from the LP. Brilliantly vibrant and overflowing with youthful confidence and adolescent lust, all centered around a chart-ready hook, **Parlours** have all the makings of a very successful band.",
