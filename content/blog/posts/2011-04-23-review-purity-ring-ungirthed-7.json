Their work is slow, seductively enchanting and wonderfully angelic. Title track _Ungirthed_ closest contemporary is perhaps Lykke Li, capturing her innocent yet assertive tone while mixing the style with an electronic infused twist. Definitely a group to watch out for. Check out the _track Ungirthed_ as well as the B-side _[Lofticries](http://soundcloud.com/purity-ring/lofticries)_ below.
