  "body": "Photo by **_[Kenis Federico](http://www.flickr.com/photos/federicokenis/)_**\n\nThere are three types of collaboration in this world, ones that make sense, ones that don’t and ones that come out of nowhere. **Nautic** falls into the latter category, or maybe the first, fuck it maybe even both, evidently that theory didn’t work. But anyway, the 3-piece is made up of **Bullion**, **Laura Groves** (who used to make folk-pop as **Blue Roses**) and **Tic** of the Young Turks label, with their debut track also featuring the rather naughty saxophone tones of the ever dear to our hearts, **Slime**. In the simplest terms, ‘_Fresh Eyes_’ is an extremely promising piece of material. It never truly feels like a finished sound, but as a statement of intent it makes the process behind the making the track seem effortless, almost inevitable.",
