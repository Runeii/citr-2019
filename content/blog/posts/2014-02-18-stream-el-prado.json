  "body": "857 days have passed since LA outfit **NO** appeared on the pages of CitR with their debut single, _Stay With Me_, and the song is still as gloriously uplifting as the day I first heard it.\n\nNow, almost two and a half years later, the sextet are gearing up for the release of their debut LP, _**El Prado**_, through Arts & Crafts. It’s a worn out cliche, but there really are few bands who have worked as hard as **NO** over the past couple of years, with several colossal tours already under their belts, and presumably more to come, this LP really feels like a combination of their talent and perseverance truly paying off. Cinematic, bold and deeply effecting on an emotional level, it’s a brilliant record, with fantastic songwriting at the very core of it.\n\nStream the full LP below, including personal highlights _Hold On_ and _So Scared._",
