  "body": "The opening minute or so of this debut video from **JLYY** wouldn’t seem out of place had it come from now defunct Mancunian heavy-pop outfit **WU LYF**.\n\nReverb-laden guitars and near anguished howls, all set against a backdrop of undecipherable visuals, it’s buzzworthy personified, and likely to kick up quite a fuss. Only several days into the year, I can already guarantee that you’re unlikely to hear a debut track as bold or as confident as _Glass Drum_ over the course of the next twelve months.",
