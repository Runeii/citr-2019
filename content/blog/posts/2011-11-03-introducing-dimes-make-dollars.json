  "body": "Detroit’s **Dimes Make Dollars** combine the sleaze and sexual inclination of **The Weeknd** with the dubstep inspired beats of **James Blake**.\n\nWhilst the production on the self-titled debut track may leave more to be desired, the basic elements for a fantastic R’n’B track are all there. Timing, seduction, lust and a slickly refined beat, all combining to make this one hell of an exciting first appearance from **Dimes Make Dollars**. Check out the self-titled track below.\n\n<a href=\"http://dimesmakedollars.bandcamp.com/track/dimes-make-dollars\">Dimes Make Dollars by Dimes Make Dollars</a>",
