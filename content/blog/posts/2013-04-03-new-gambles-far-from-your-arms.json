  "body": "Premiered over on Gorilla vs Bear, Gambles has revealed the first track from his debut EP ‘From Your Arms’ which is due for release on May 7th.\n\nHauntingly beautiful, ‘Far From Your Arms’ may be found by many as lying between cliche and sincerity. However the cliche is an unfortunate factor outside of the control of Gambles himself, and rather it is a symptom of what has been a relentless emergence of male (and female) singer-songwriters in the past few years. In this haze of a plethora of shaky vocals and plucky guitars, Gambles stands above with a humble mastery that sparks thoughts of Crack in the Road favourites **M O N E Y**. While Jamie Lee employs a more poetic vernacular, they share a galvanizing vulnerability that immediately strikes and remains with you in a resonating emotional echo.\n\n_You breathe my lungs, you keep me strong_",
