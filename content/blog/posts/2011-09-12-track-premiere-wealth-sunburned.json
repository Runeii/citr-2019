  "body": "Our first introduction to **[Wealth](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/8196-introducing-wealth/ \"Introducing: Wealth\")** was way back in May. The ever-reliable **[Housewarming Records](http://housewarmingrecords.bandcamp.com/)** brought him to our attentions; he had just been signed by them and released a tropical little banger to prove his worth. It’s been a few months now and Wealth is back with a jam to end the summer. The tropical and sun soaked sounds are still ever present, yet there’s a remarkable new level of scope to the sound. The work is less thin in its delivery, describing it as epic might be a bit general, but it comes remarkably close. The new single, Sunburned, comes out tomorrow along with an unheard B-side. For now stream the new single below and check in at **[Housewarming Records’](http://housewarmingrecords.bandcamp.com/)** Band Camp page tomorrow to pick up the single for free.\n\n [Wealth – Sunburned](http://soundcloud.com/crackintheroad/wealth-sunburned) by [crackintheroad](http://soundcloud.com/crackintheroad)",
