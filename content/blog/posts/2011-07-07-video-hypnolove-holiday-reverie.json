Appearing to take influence from those dreadful, obscure holiday advertising videos shown late at night, there’s plenty of beautiful women, idyllic beaches and 80’s inspired work out shots. The track itself is a summer gem, gloriously upbeat and insanely catchy, with plenty of synths and bass to boost the overall sunshine drenched vibe. Check out Holiday Reverie below.",
