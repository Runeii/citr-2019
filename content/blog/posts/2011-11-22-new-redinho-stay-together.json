  "body": "**Numbers** just dropped the new single from **Redinho**.\n\nThis man really has heaps loads of talent. His first two EP’s for the label, _Bare Blips_ and _Edge Off_, were two of the best from the entire label, in my opinion. He can make the most mindfucking noises that sound out of this world. What I also love is the odd track has great **D_â_m-Funk**\\-esque vocoded vocals – as is apparent in this one. He’s playing **Boiler Room** once again tonight, as part of the **Numbers** showcase, alongside **Randomer**, **Mosca**, **Deadboy** and hosts **Jackmaster** & **Spencer** (tune in at 8pm).\n\nThis single’s out at the beginning of December, and it really does hit the right spots – as with the addictiveness of **Rustie**‘s recent release, **Redinho**‘s track sours to greater heights at every break. The electronic voraciousness escalates and disappears into glee. I hate to type that last word but this guy really does make brilliant, and _fun_, electronic funk. One truly worthy for Christmas number one.\n\n_Listen to Stay Together below. The single is out December 5th via Numbers, and will be part of his debut album, out ‘sometime 2012’._",
