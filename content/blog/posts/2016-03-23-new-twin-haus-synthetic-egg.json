  "body": "I first stumbled across Brisbane’s **Twin Haus** a couple of years back, with their epic debut _Lumberjack Loveshack_, and in truth, I’d sort of lost track of what the outfit were up to.\n\nThankfully, they came back onto my radar at the tail end of last week, thanks to their equally as monumental new track _Synthetic Egg_, lifted from a new EP titled Nothing Lavish. A sprawling, nine minute Radiohead and Brand New indebted track, the first two minutes initially come across as slightly cumbersome, yet as the song progresses, all the various complex ends merge together in a beautiful, ambitiously cataclysmic number. Check it out below.\n\nFollow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
