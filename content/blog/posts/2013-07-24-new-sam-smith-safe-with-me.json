  "date": "2013-07-24T20:08:21",
  "body": "Having lent his vocals to two of the biggest singles of recent years (_Latch_ by **Disclosure** and _La La La_ by **Naughty Boy**), 21 year old singer **Sam Smith** has been busy preparing his own solo material, alongside playing a run of festivals.\n\n_Safe With Me_ is lifted from his debut three track EP, set for release through PMR (Disclosure, Jessie Ware etc.) later this year, and was premiered earlier this evening on [MistaJam’s 1xtra Show](www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0071stt). As to be expected, it plays to the soulful vocals of **Smith**, whilst also offering itself up to be ready for indie dancefloors around the country, courtesy of the choppy, almost hip-hop production from **Two Inch Punch**. Let’s be honest, it’s one of the singles of the year. Also, keep it locked for his debut full length expected next year. Check out _Safe With Me_ below.\n\n_don’t you know that you’re safe with me / all your worries can be put to sleep_",
