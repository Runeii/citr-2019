  "body": "It’s fair to say that **Juice’s** online presence might need a little bit of work; with a Twitter feed for her old band that appears to have been inactive for well over a year (alongside announcing a debut album for 2012), no Soundcloud, and links to Reverb Nation (people still use Reverb Nation?!)… or maybe she’s just playing it very cool.\n\nAnything, there’s nothing wrong with her newest track, _All Tied Up_, a gloriously uplifting folk-pop outing. Check it out below.\n\n<a href=\"http://juiceismusic.bandcamp.com/track/all-tied-up\">All Tied Up by Juice</a>",
