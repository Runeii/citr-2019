  "body": "Having just announced her signing by R&S imprint Apollo Records, North East born singer-songwriter **Nadine Shah** has unveiled the lead track from her forthcoming EP.\n\n_Dreary Town_, a piano led ballad, is piercingly beautiful, overflowing with subtle inflections, and contrary to much press that has described her as embodying a spirit and talent far beyond her years, it’s the inexperience and youthful desire that makes for such an engaging listen. Dark, brooding and emotionally unrelenting, it carries the mark of an immensely gifted young artist. (PS listen out for the ‘nowt’s)",
