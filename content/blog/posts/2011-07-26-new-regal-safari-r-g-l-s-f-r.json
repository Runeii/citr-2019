  "body": "[Regal Safari](http://www.facebook.com/regalsafari)’s first single, _Light_, was a carefree delight, amongst the blissfully free spirited tones however, was a level of intricacy that gave the tune an exciting level of depth. He’s just released a debut EP, entitled R G L S F R, and it continues in that delightful vein. Synth tones glare and pop amongst glisteningly soulful vocal arrangements, Safari is very much an artist that can smother you in a groove. I am willing to be smothered.\n\nStream and DL the record below.\n\n<a href=\"http://regalsafari.bandcamp.com/album/r-g-l-s-f-r\">R G L S F R by Regal Safari</a>",
