  "body": "Sounds like **Chaz Bundick** has been listening to **The Neptunes**, based on the slick-hop vibes emanating from this new track.\n\n_So Many Details_ will be the first single taken from his forthcoming album _**Anything In Return**_ out 22 January via [Carpark Records](http://www.carparkrecords.com/), and is a more than promising indication of what’s to come. Having well and truly ditched the chillwave sound, Bundick also ramps up the production and cost in the video, which in truth, is more glitzy **Frank Ocean** than DIY **Toro y Moi** that we’d experienced in the past.",
