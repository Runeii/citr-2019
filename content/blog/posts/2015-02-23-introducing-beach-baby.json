  "body": "Uplifting, infectiously melodic, and with the driving ferocity of a locomotive, Beach Baby’s debut offering, ‘Ladybird’.\n\nis a very strong effort indeed. Channeling influences of British post-punk and 80’s New Wave, ‘Ladybird’ undulates within a fine haze of apathy without ever becoming lost in the sonic mist, taking the listener to moments of reflection before then thrusting them straight back into the unrelenting movement of the current.\n\nFormed as a four piece, and originally meeting at London’s Goldsmiths College, Beach Baby are very much making the first steps in their career, however with their debut single due out on Chess Club Records/B3SCI on March 30th, along with their debut live shows (listed below), they’ve made the prospect of summer that much more exciting.\n\nSun 29th March – Paris, La Cigale (w/Jungle)\n\nWeds 8th April – Brighton, Prince Albert\n\nThurs 9th April – Salford, Eagle Inn\n\nSat 11th April – Cardiff, Dim Swn Festival\n\nWeds 15th April – London, Courtyard Theatre",
