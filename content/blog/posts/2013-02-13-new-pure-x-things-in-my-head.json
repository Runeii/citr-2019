  "body": "This year is shaping up to be a fantastic year for music, with brilliant albums from Unknown Mortal Orchestra, Youth Lagoon and Rhye already released / on their way, and now Austin’s **Pure X** have announced details of their forthcoming sophomore record.\n\nCrawling Up The Stairs will be released 14 May via Acephale Records, with _Things In My Head_ being the first single taken from the LP. Less shoegaze driven than previous releases, it’s a bolder, more rounded sound, in truth not too far from the slick-rock temperament of UMO. Check it out underneath, and pre-order the record [here](acephale.bigcartel.com/).",
