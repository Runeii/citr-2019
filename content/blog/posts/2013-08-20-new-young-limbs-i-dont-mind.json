  "body": "_I don’t mind you talking to me / your eyes are pretty and your face is sweet / I don’t mind you walking my way / I like to listen to the things you say_\n\nUK outfit **Young Limbs** are very un-British sounding, coming across far more like the ‘cool’ bands currently emerging from Brooklyn.\n\nTheir fantastic debut track, _I Don’t Mind_, lands somewhere between Ariel Pink and the Beach Boys, fuzzy, slightly trippy surf-pop. Whilst it’s only their premiere outing, upon the strength of this one track, **Young Limbs** could well be one of the most exciting new British bands to appear this year.",
