  "body": "I came to this backwards.\n\nMy first encounter with **Grandfather Birds** was secondhand, by way of side project [Nately’s Whore’s Kid Sister](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/12744-introducing-natelys-whores-kid-sister/ \"\"...five young adult males who sound like they exist on a diet of booze, blunts and raw beef.\"\"), whose astounding EP _**Ribs**_  is somehow as angelic and soaring as it is weighed down by filth and sludge. Listening to _Things Beneath The Water _and _Spithope_, which Grandfather Birds have very kindly put up for free download, that first facet of the Nately’s sound starts to make a lot more sense.\n\nWhile _Spithope_ does a fine job of swelling from a condensed history of British indie rock to a cathedral-sized coda, it’s _Things Beneath The Water_ that’s the real joy here, a crystalline six-string ping-pong that flickers its way into one of the most addictive, expansive, wide-eyed hooks I’ve heard this year. Grandfather Birds have kindly put the two tracks up for free download on [bandcamp](http://grandfatherbirds.bandcamp.com/ \"But pay or I'll eat you.\"), so y’know, go there.",
