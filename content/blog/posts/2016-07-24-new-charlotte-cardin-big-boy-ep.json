  "body": "Over the course of the past few months **Charlotte Cardin** has gradually been amassing a collection of A\\* level tracks – which have now been collated together as her debut EP.\n\nFeaturing one of my favourite tracks of the year in the form of _Like It Doesn’t Hurt_, alongside the Amy Winehouse channeling new track, _Dirty Dirty_, there’s no doubt in my eyes that Charlotte Cardin is the most important emerging artist of the year. Check out a couple of EP tracks below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
