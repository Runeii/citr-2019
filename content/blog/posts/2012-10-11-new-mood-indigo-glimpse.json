  "body": "Boston’s **Mood Indigo** just gets better and better with every track he conjures up.\n\nWith his vocal production improving each time, and his beats becoming more unique allowing his music to develop a characteristic entirely of it’s own. _Glimpse_ is quite possibly his finest outing to date, with spliced vocal samples and delirious synth sections, whilst remaining a true to it’s roots pop number. So it verges on the dreaded ‘chillwave’, but c’mon, it’s so much more than just that. Check out _Glimpse_ below and grab a free download.",
