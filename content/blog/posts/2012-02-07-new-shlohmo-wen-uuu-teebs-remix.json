  "body": "After [**Teebs**’](http://www.facebook.com/teebsio) lovely little album, **_Collection 01_**, dropped a few months ago, I was pretty fucking certain I would listen to anything that cat created. Sure there are limits, but the list was as long as my arm. K-pop, gothic soul, steam punk aquatic inspired folk; I’ll leave it there because the list is really long.\n\nAnd now this, not exactly K-pop but I can forgive him for that. His re-work of the **[Shlohmo](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Shlohmo/215424843565?ref=ts)** track ‘**_Wen uuu_**’ dissolves, melts and surrounds the consciousness. Each element of the track become beautifully harmonized entities, gracefully dancing around **Shlohmo**’s original work.\n\nVia **[Breathing Beats.](http://www.facebook.com/breathingbeats)**\n\nStream it below.",
