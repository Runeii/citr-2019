This time with their fantastic new single Cosmic Oceans, featuring the vocal talents of LA songstress Steffaloo. It’s a hazy, reverb filled affair, immersed with elements of My Bloody Valentine-esque shoegaze, yet mainting a downtempo, dubstep like, laid back vibe. Made available to listen to and download  via bandcamp, and a 12″ single in the near future, be sure not to miss Cosmic Oceans off your sound of summer 2011 playlists.\n\n<a href=\"http://sunglitters.bandcamp.com/album/cosmic-oceans-feat-steffaloo\">cosmic oceans (feat.
