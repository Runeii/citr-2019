This week has seen the US release of their new extended EP, Forgotten Thoughts, mixing blissful beats with boisterous pop melodies. Six tracks, divided up by three intriguing and chirpy interludes, make up Forgotten Thoughts.\n\nOpener Swimming in Pink Waters is majestic and adventurous, everything that epitomizes the current chillwave scene. Elsewhere on the EP, In Dreams begins with a disco-inspired beat, before opening out into an expansive field of shimmering vocals and gleaming samples. The vocal themselves appear hugely influenced by My Bloody Valentine at their To Here Knows When best, light and cautiously layered. Dreams don’t excel on vocal ability, nor do they rely upon it, choosing to focus on the instrumental values embedded in their compositions. Forgotten Thoughts is a confident debut release, taking the human consciousness on a memorable flight through animated synths and effervescent reverb laden pop.\n\n[In Dreams – Dreams](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/4458-review-dreams-forgotten-thoughts/attachment/06-in-dreams)",
