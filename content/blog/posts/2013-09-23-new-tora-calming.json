  "body": "Australia’s **Tora** only released their debut ‘Demo’s EP a matter of weeks ago, and are already back on the horse with new track _Calming Her_.\n\nAs with their previous four tracks, it’s minimal, deeply emotive electronica, in the vein of **James Blake** or **SOHN**, built upon a foundation of sampled vocals and looped synths. Check out Calming Her below, and keep up with Tora on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Toramusic).",
