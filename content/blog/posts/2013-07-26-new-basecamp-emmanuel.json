  "body": "Nashville trio **BASECAMP**, aka Aaron Miller, Aaron C.\n\nHarmon and Jordan Reyes, have a sound that’s about as current as any new artist round. Glitchy R&B may well be in abundance at this moment in time, but there’s few doing it quite as well as this trio, as shown by their addictive debut outing, _Emmanuel_. Layered vocals and choppy synths all underpinned by an almost early 00’s UK garage style beat form what is be one of the finest introductions to any artist this year.",
