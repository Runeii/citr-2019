  "body": "LA duo Dream Stretcher are unashamedly ‘dream pop’ even going so far as to describe themselves as such, and it’s relatively clear from the word go who their influences are.\n\nProduction wise, new track _The Fall_ is like a less dance orientated **Purity Ring** track, whereas the vocals are part **Beach House**, part **Holychild**; 100% dreamy. Whilst **Dream Stretcher** are very much under the radar for the time-being, with a few more tracks to the same quality as the three so far, and they’ll surely begin to attract attention. Stream all three below.",
