  "body": "So far, **Fucked Up** have been the discovery of the year for me.\n\nIn a fit of uncharacteristic adventurousness (it can be difficult to get excited about music when you’re working 60 hour weeks) I gave the Toronto sextet’s latest opus **_David Comes to Life_**, from which _The Other Shoe_ is lifted, a listen sometime around its release in June, and I have not looked back since. An 18 song concept album about an Englishman slogging away in a lightbulb factory before falling in love with a communist firebrand? Sounds like a hardcore band playing Springsteen and loving it from start to finish? Fucking sold. Detailing another vignette from the chronicles of David’s life, the video for _The Other Shoe_ (which is a personal favourite anyway) is beautifully shot, and has left me wishing that the band would just go on and record a feature length to run alongside the album. Here’s hoping.",
