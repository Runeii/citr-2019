  "date": "2013-05-15T22:20:42",
  "body": "Announcing himself with his rather fantastic debut track _Pieces_, French dark-pop maestro **Wolvs** has dropped his second offering, the seductively simple _Stumble_.\n\nThe structure may be desirably straight forward, but the sound itself is telling hard to pin down, neither giving in to the pop tendencies, nor distancing itself entirely from synth drive pop hits. Check out _Stumble_ below.",
