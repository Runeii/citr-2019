  "body": "Lo-fi appears to be all the rage at the moment, and Michigan’s **Silence Dogood** appear very much like they’ve been brought up solely on a diet of _**Slanted And Enchanted**_ and 90’s Americana, nothing wrong with that though.\n\nTheir debut track _Granola Kids_ sounds like it’s been recorded on a toaster; fuzzy vocals, deliriously imperfect guitars and a huge serving of genuine teenage angst/humour. In fact, _Granola Kids_ may not seem it from the off, but it’s lyrically inspired – _“Neon girls who don’t react, sign electronic suicide pacts”_ and my personal favourite, _“What’s my Muslim name today? I invent religious holidays. We resurrected Kurt Cobain, housebreaking all his dusty cliches”_. Sublime.\n\n<a href=\"http://silencedonegood.bandcamp.com/track/granola-kids\">Granola Kids by Silence Dogood</a>",
