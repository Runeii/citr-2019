  "body": "**Oliver Nelson** has been nothing short of prolific to date – with six number one Hype Machine tracks to his name, sold out shows in Europe and the US and backing from the likes of Kygo, Tensnake and Blonde, it’s no wonder he’s being hotly tipped as the next big name in dance music.\n\nHis latest offering, _Changes_, features the vocal talents of South London’s **River**, and finds him merging some early 00’s R&B vibes with slick, more modern songwriting. Changes is out on Friday, [pre-order here](https://exit.sc/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapple.co%2F28JjZ0O) and check out a couple of upcoming show dates below.\n\n03/09/2016\n\nKitsune Showcase\n\nThe Magic Roundabout (London)\n\n16/09/2016\n\nPerfect Havoc Disco\n\nShowCase (Paris)",
