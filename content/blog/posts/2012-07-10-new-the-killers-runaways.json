  "body": "**The Killers** will always hold a special place in my heart, not due to the quality of their albums, nor their debatable game changing sound, but because of their faultless live performances.\n\nSure, I’d never really put their music on my iPod, let alone purchase it, but for a festival live act, there are few better. New single _Runaways_ (taken from forthcoming album _**Battle Born**_) appeared on the web earlier this morning and is everything we’ve come to expect from **The Killers**; extravagant, slick and wonderfully vocally pronounced. Be prepared to hear this track again and again over the course of the next few months.",
