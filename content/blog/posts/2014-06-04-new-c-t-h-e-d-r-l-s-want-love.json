  "body": "SF duo **C A T H E D R A L S** were always going to end up on a pretty cool label, so it’s no surprise to hear that they’re set to release their debut EP through [Neon Gold](http://neongoldrecords.com/) later in the year. Improving with every song they release, their third track, _Want My Love_ throws some slick, R&B vibes into the mix, featuring their most confident vocal outing yet. Check it out below, and keep your eyes out for the EP, expected in the summer.",
