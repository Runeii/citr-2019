  "body": "I can’t really find too much information on **Alex Waters**, aside from the fact that he hails from Lismore; presumably in Australia, not Scotland.\n\nI make that assumption judging by the tranquil, carefree vibes of debut track _Wood Smoke_, which combines pop and electronic influences into a fascinating acoustically driven number. Comparisons could be drawn to **Washed Out** through the smooth vocals and languid synths, however the choruses are more contained and less extravagant. It’s clearly that **Alex Waters** is not the complete article yet, although judging by the strength of _Wood Smoke_, this young artist is set to stir up some serious waves.\n\nCheck out _Wood Smoke_ below.\n\n<a href=\"http://alexwaters.bandcamp.com/track/wood-smoke\">Wood Smoke by Alex Waters</a>",
