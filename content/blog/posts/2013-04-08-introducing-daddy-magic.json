Anyway, the first twenty seconds or so of **Daddy Magic’s** _Tug_ sounds a little bit like the Californian rockers, thankfully, that’s the only comparison, and it’s not long before the song descends into a brilliantly frantic, self-depreciating pop-punk barrage. _‘It’s alright / I know you’ve been hurt / but I’m just too sick to apologize / I’ll get my day of repentance babe’_ bemoans Daddy Magic during the almost Strokes-esque chorus. On the flip-side _Another Tonight_, veers into ‘love-song’ territory, whilst remaining stoically tongue in cheek and wonderfully upbeat. Check out both tracks below.",
