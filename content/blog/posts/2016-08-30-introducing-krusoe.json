  "body": "There’s a unassuming funkiness that underpins S.\n\nO.S, the debut track from **Krusoe** – an almost swagger that develops as the track builds. Merging classical influences with more contemporary, electronic inspirations, there’s enough of a pop edge for it to be addictive and accessible, whilst also feeling like Krusoe is carving out a sound uniquely his own. _S.O.S._ is the first of hopefully much more to come.
