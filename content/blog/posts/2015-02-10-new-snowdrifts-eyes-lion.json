  "body": "**Snowdrifts** – no information, a dozen Facebook fans, < 1000 Soundcloud plays.\n\nIt’s a usual story, and one that’s starting to run its course in truth. That said, their debut track, Eyes of a Lion is promising. It’s maybe a little too ‘vibey’, and verges upon ‘nice’ at times (way too much ‘nice’ music in 2015, i.e. doesn’t leave a lasting impression, just sort of drifts by), but there’s something here, and with a little development of sound, and a more distinctive take on the vocals, then yeah, could be cool.\n\n(I can’t remember who reposted this for it to appear on my Soundcloud feed, apologies if it was you)",
