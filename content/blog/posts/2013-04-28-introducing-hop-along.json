It doesn’t matter whether she’s chucking out [playground taunts](http://hopalong.bandcamp.com/track/kids-on-the-boardwalk \"Genuinely hilarious. \") like _“my mom says your mom’s a lesbian__”_ over a pure pop piano stomp, or turning [the nonsensical](http://hopalong.bandcamp.com/track/laments \"I don't ever want to know what this means. \") _“the mattress-maker’s making his livin’ by the minute”_ into the most necessary sentence you’ve ever heard while guitars go napalm and someone approximates a kid hammering at a keyboard. It doesn’t matter if she’s just barely breathing about [trouble finding her sleeping](http://hopalong.bandcamp.com/track/trouble-found-me \"It will. \") and her subsequent journey downstairs, unspecified dread lurking just at the edge of everything. Frances Quinlan has a way of making everything sound like it’s the last thing she’ll ever sing.\n\nWith Mark Quinlan and Tyler Long, Frances Quinlan sings and plays guitar in a band from Philadelphia called **Hop Along**, whose debut full-length  _**Get Disowned**_  is one of the most wonderful, peculiar, addictive, lopsided, explosive collections of songs in an unspecified subgenre of rock music that I have heard in a long, long, long time.\n\n_**Get Disowned**_  is out now via [Big Scary Monsters](http://bsmrocks.bigcartel.com/product/hop-along-get-disowned-lp \"Terrifying. \"). Hop Along play the [Old Blue Last](https://www.facebook.com/events/103290126522634/?fref=ts \"Laters.\") tonight with The Sidekicks, Muncie Girls and Plaids.",
