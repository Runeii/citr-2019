  "date": "2012-01-14T19:02:33",
  "body": "**Operator Please** know their way around a pop track, so it makes sense that **Colour Coding**, the side-project of **Chris Holland** and T**im Commandeur**, also embodies the spirit of huge, joyous indie anthems.\n\nHaving announced themselves in November of last year with the effervescent _Perfect_, the duo are back with the insanely danceable _Kick_. Sure, it’s not breaking boundaries musically, but it’s indie-pop songwriting at it’s utmost enjoyable. Stream _Kick_ below, and check out their debut EP _**Proof**_ which drops later in the year.\n\n<a href=\"http://colourcodingband.bandcamp.com/track/kick\">Kick by Colour Coding</a>",
