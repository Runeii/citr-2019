  "body": "**Clea’s** mesmerising debut track released a couple of years back cropped up on a handful of top Spotify playlists and has clocked up an impressive two million streams to date – not bad for a track with no PR push behind it.\n\nNow with a label behind her (Mirror Music Group) she’s staking her place as one of Australia’s most exciting new talents, and her latest single, _Bright Blue_, acts as a timely reminder of her songwriting talent. Somewhere between the psychedelic vibe or Tame Impala and the more intimate storytelling beauty of Laura Marling or Angel Olsen, Bright Blue is an intoxicating listen.",
