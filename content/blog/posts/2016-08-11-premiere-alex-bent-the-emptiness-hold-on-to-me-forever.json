  "body": "Canada’s **Alex Bent + The Emptiness** showcases some super slick songwriting on his latest track, _Hold On To Me Forever_.\n\nDrawing from a whole host of emerging Toronto R&B artists, alongside elements from the likes of of How To Dress Well and Blood Orange, it’s emotionally poignant yet utterly addictive. Whilst vulnerable in parts, there still manages to be a sultry confidence in the songwriting; truly the sign of an artist on top of their game. With an album out later this month, it’s set to be exciting few months for the Saskatoon singer. Check it out below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
