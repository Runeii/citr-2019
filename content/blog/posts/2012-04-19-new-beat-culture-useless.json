  "body": "Following on from the phenomenal success of his attempt at remixing [**The XX**](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/15576-new-the-xx-shelter-beat-culture-remix/), bedroom producer **Beat Culture** has dropped a new cut in the form of the glittering _Useless_. Despite his career still being very much in it’s infancy, there’s a real sense of development and learning experienced on each and every new track that **Kim** releases. Whether it’s learning new techniques, finding slicker samples or adding the final finishing touches to his work, **Beat Culture** is maturing far faster than anyone could have predicted.",
