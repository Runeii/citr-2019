  "date": "2012-11-03T13:43:42",
  "body": "Here’s a brainteaser for you, what has five letters and is in some way relevant to [Foals](http://www.foals.co.uk/)? The UK indie outfit have launched a new website with a cryptic code on the front page, consisting of five spaces, that must be filled with letters or numbers, in order to access a hidden part to the page. With their new album **_Holy Fire_** out 11 Feb 2013, it’s highly likely to be somehow related to that, but aside from that, we’re stumped.\n\nEDIT: Turns out the code is [HRCPT](http://www.foals.co.uk/unlock/hrcpt.htm) and accesses a looped audio file.\n\nEDIT: Or use [VEKSD](www.foals.co.uk/unlock/veksd.htm?key=suawgx55shugdrnf23kiuu45) to access a remix of Inhaler by Tom Vek.",
