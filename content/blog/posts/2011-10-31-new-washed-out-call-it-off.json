  "body": "This new track from Georgia’s **Washed Out** will feature as the B-side to upcoming single _Amor Fati_, out 14 November.\n\nContinuing very much in the delicate, synth-pop vein of recent album _**Within And Without**_, _Call It Off_ is slightly more dance orientated, with even more emphasis placed on the electro inspired hooks and reverb soaked vocals. As always with **Washed Out**, the percussion section is exaggerated and builds throughout the track, maintaining a steady, wholesome feel. Check out _Call It Off_ below.\n\n [Washed Out – Call It Off](http://soundcloud.com/weirdworldrecordco/washed-out-call-it-off) by [WeirdWorldRecordCo](http://soundcloud.com/weirdworldrecordco)\n\nImage sourced from [The NJ Underground](http://thenjunderground.com/blog/2011/7/25/washed-out-covers-chris-isaaks-wicked-game-live-on-siriusxm.html).",
