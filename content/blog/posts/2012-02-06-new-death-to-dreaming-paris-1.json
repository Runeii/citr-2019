  "date": "2012-02-06T23:37:20",
  "body": "Yet another act gracing the pages of _**CitR**_ whom seemingly have sprung up out of nowhere.\n\nTheir debut track _Paris 1_ has a rough round the edges feel to it, yet the refined shine of a well-produced indie gem. It’s remorseful and thought-provoking in parts, relying upon the **Interpol** like guitar line to carry the track. **Death To Dreaming** float with such ease that it’s impossible to find any flaws in particular, with _Paris 1_ sidling by with an effervescent charm. Check out _Paris 1_ below and grab a free download if you feel like it.\n\n<a href=\"http://deathtodreaming.bandcamp.com/track/paris-1\">Paris 1 by Death To Dreaming</a>",
