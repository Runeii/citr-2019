  "body": "**Sunboy** are one of my favourite new bands in the world right now.\n\nThey’re bold, ambitious and a shedload of fun, not to mention awesome songwriters. Having wowed with a few tracks toward the tail end of last year, the Colorado duo are back with latest cut, _Nu Religion_. Another slice of woozy, Tame Impala inspired indie-rock, it’s wonderfully in your face and over the top. With the right team behind them, and a few more tracks to the quality of those already released, there will truly be no stopping Sunboy.",
