With pre-orders for the album going up tomorrow at Crash Symbol’s [bandcamp](http://crashsymbols.bandcamp.com/album/the-ocean), it’s one of their most highly anticipated releases to date. Sunset, available to listen to and download below is the second track on The Ocean, a moving narrative recounting a night spent at sea, a piece of music that has to be experienced to be truly understood.\n\nHere is what Jamison had to say about The Ocean:\n\n“The new Two Bicycles record is one of the most personal records I’ve made to date. Even though there aren’t any vocals on the record, I feel that I’ve expressed myself more clearly than I have on any other release I’ve done. Although this is a “side project”, I take these songs as seriously as I do the songs for the Teen Daze project.\n\nThe record tells the story of a night spent at sea. The beauty and hope that comes with the watching of the sun set, swimming in the moonlight and looking back at life back on land in fondness and happiness. But as the night falls, and the endless ocean reveals itself as the chaotic, exilic wilderness, the main character begins to feel isolated and on edge. The ocean can bring both optimism and fear, hope and loneliness.\n\nThe album was recorded in my bedroom, at the base of Mt. Cheam in Chilliwack, BC, from November 2010 to January 2011.”\n\n[Two Bicycles – Sunset](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/02-Sunset.mp3) (Left click stream, right click- save as download)\n\n[Pre-order The Ocean here from tomorrow.](http://crashsymbols.bandcamp.com/album/the-ocean)",
