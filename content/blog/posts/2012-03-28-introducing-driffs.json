  "body": "Australia appears to be a fertile breeding ground for new music at the moment, with a host of exciting synth and eletronic acts popping up all over the country.\n\nSydney based four piece **Driffs** are the epitome of the vibrant scene, with their upbeat, dreamily nostalgic debut tracks. _Ocean Sounds_ is a summer surf-pop gem, with it’s dazzlingly addictive hook and reverb drenched vocals, ushering in the warmer months with wonderfully sweet aplomb. On the second of their demo tracks, _Wake Up_, **Driffs** adopt a more seductive tone, whilst again basing much of the song around the splendid guitar line. Check out both tracks below, and keep up with the four piece via [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/driffs).",
