She has been showcasing new material live for the first time from her new album, _I Speak Before I Can_, as well as throwing in a [couple of old songs and a Neil Young cover](http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/laura-marling/2010/the-lowry-manchester-england-4bd48746.html). But this isn’t the only reason to check out her latest shows. Support not only comes from singer-songwriter **Alessi’s Ark**, but also Australian folk outfit **Boy & Bear**.\n\nThe four members of **Boy & Bear** all fronted various musical acts before coming together to form the current band last year. From experimental music to singer-songwriters, the band members have found their natural balancing point in their three part harmonies of Americana folk. Because of this, it is almost too obvious to draw the parallels with **Fleet Foxes**, yet, due to their vast array of influences, they still manage to sound fresh and exciting – a feat which few new bands achieve nowadays.\n\n[Mexican Mavis](http://www.mediafire.com/?3t5jyaidwlx)",
