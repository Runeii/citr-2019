  "body": "Should probably start this article with a reference to the fact that all four members of **YURT** have their band name tattooed on their backsides – commitment to the cause or what? Their six track debut release has been hanging around my laptop tabs for a couple of weeks now – with each play proving even more endearing.\n\nWhilst the standout element of the EP is Marlo Kapsa’s raw, poignant vocals, there’s also some top quality songwriting here – most notably the Courtney Barnett-esque American Spirit. Check out a couple of tracks below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
