  "body": "Some tracks are just made for the live stage.\n\nTake one listen to [**Family History’s**](http://www.facebook.com/familyhistorymusicuk) _In Need_, and try telling me that you can’t imagine them enchanting a couple of hundred people in a sweaty, claustrophobic venue, whilst strobe lights flash in time with the delirious synths.

Dance your heart out kid.",
