  "body": "Essex duo **YSBM** (YEARSBLOOM) wear their influences on their sleeves; the likes of Mount Kimbie, The XX and James Blake all echo throughout their debut EP.\n\nThe highlight of their new release, _After Dark_, is a poignant, alluring masterpiece, almost entirely electronic in composition, yet somehow feels strangely organic. I remember seeing James Blake live a few years ago, and feeling that he relied as much upon the carefully placed silences, as he did the beautiful music itself, and **YSBM** feel much like that.  Mark my words, YSBM are all set for the big time. Check out my two favourites from the EP below, and then the full EP under that.",
