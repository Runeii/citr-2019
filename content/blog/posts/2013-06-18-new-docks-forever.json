  "body": "Ever since **Foals** decided to become a U2 cover band, there’s been an opening in my heart for intelligent, quirky math-pop, and Genoa’s **DOCKS** may well be the ones to fill the gaping hole.\n\nHaving only formed earlier this year, the quartet comprised of Andre, Carlo, Matte and Wil, bear a striking sonic resemblance to the tracks that first made a name for Foals (Hummer, Cassius etc.), with their jerky guitar lines and percussion driven builds. It’s not often that Italian acts feature on CitR, and it’s even less frequent for me to be so excited about an Italian act, so cherish this one whilst you can. Check out _Forever_ below, and keep up with **DOCKS** via [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Docks/239054286231639).",
