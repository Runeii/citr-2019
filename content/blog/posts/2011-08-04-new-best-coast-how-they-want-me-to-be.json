  "body": "LA surf pop darlings **Best Coast** have dropped another new track, the deliciously **Warpaint**\\-esque _How They Want Me To Be_.\n\nAfter premiering the Drew Barrymore directed star studded music video for [**Our Deal**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7YZVtLtwGE) only a couple of days ago, **Bethany Cosentino** is clearly in a vein of rich songwriting form. _How They Want Me To Be_ is searingly honest and gloriously lo-fi, as we’ve come to expect from Best Coast, with Cosentino bemoaning, _“I don’t want to be how they want me to be, I want you”_. With Bethany confirming on her [blog](http://bestycoasty.blogspot.com/) that a sophomore Best Coast album is ‘still very far away from being created’, this track serves as a taster to tide over their legions of eager fans.\n\n**Best Coast** aren’t allowing _How They Want Me To Be_ to be embedded yet, so instead follow this [link](http://soundcloud.com/bestcoastt/how-they-want-me-to-be) to hear the track.",
