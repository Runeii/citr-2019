  "body": "Rachel Brotman spent the tail end of last year on tour with Autre Ne Veut, and since coming back has reinvented herself under the **Raia Was** moniker.\n\nOriginally put on to her by a collaboration of hers with Tyler Gilmore, her solo track, _Grant it Cause_, available on her Soundcloud, is a luscious concoction of disjointed beats and almost whispered, layered vocals, all shimmering with an ethereal and ephemeral quality. Truly, this is rather special. Check out _Grant it Cause_ below, as well as the aforementioned collab.\n\n<a href=\"http://raiawastylergilmore.bandcamp.com/track/robot-carnival\">Robot Carnival by raia was &amp; tyler gilmore</a>",
