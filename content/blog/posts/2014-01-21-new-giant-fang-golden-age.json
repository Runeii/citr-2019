With **CHVRCHES** and younger siblings **Prides** trading the live circuit for the _mysterious_ online approach, fame and fortune soon followed.\n\nFellow Glasgow resident, Douglas Wilson, a.k.a, **GIANT** **FANG** (capital letters must be the ‘in’ thing), only has a modest 2,000 listens on his latest release and seems to have slipped under the radar slightly.
