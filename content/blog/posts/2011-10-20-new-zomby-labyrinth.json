I found it to be weaker than a lot of his past stuff on **Hyperdub**, **Ramp Recordings** and **Werk Discs**. So what he’s cheekily done now is get a Japanese bonus disc that came with **_Dedication_**, and put it on wax over here in the West. The bastard.\n\nBut I’m not gonna complain after hearing this taster. The usual rave elements are there, but this time with a devilish portion of hardcore chime powering melodically through the track, like a slowed down jungle classic. The formula may be familiar but take a step back and it’s one of his most nostalgic productions yet. If this is what we’re gonna get from this new EP, entitled _**Nothing**_, then I think I’ll expect more than just nothing.\n\n_Listen to Labyrinth below. Nothing is out on November 28th via 4AD on 12″/download._",
