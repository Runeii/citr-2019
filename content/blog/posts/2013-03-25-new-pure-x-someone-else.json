  "body": "One of the most heart-wrenching moments of the year thus far, _Someone Else_ is the latest statement of intent from Austin’s **Pure X**.\n\nDevastatingly honest and brutally cutting, it’s three and a half minutes of self-deprecation, loathing and unparalleled hatred. Documenting a time of great personal struggle, Someone Else is one of the highlights of their forthcoming LP **_Crawling Up The Stairs,_**out 14 May. Emotional doesn’t even come close.",
