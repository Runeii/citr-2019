  "body": "For those of you that missed it, Twin Shadow jumped on the GTA V soundtrack last year with the excellent _[Old Love/New Love](https://www.</p><p>youtube.com/watch?v=JFiDnErxU_A \"Old Love / New Love - Twin Shadow - YouTube\")_, and in the process, heset the bar pretty high for melancholic, beat-driven dance tunes. This time he’s back with the anthemic _To The Top, _which could be as close to an ’80s power ballad as you’ll get this year.\n\n_To The Top_ is a free download, so jump on that. Word is, he’s also currently spending time in the studio working on the follow up to **_Confess_**. It’s time to get excited.\n\n(via [Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com/news/54779-twin-shadow-share-to-the-top/ \"Pitchfork - Twin Shadow Share \"To the Top\"\"))",
