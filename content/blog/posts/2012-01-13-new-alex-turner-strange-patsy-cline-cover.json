  "body": "It’s always pretty funny when **Arctic Monkeys** appear on US foreign shows; their wit and British humor tend to confuse the presenters, not to mention their gritty Sheffield accents.\n\nLead singer **Alex Turner** appeared on Triple J recently, and performed a cover of **Patsy Cline’s** 1961 classic _Strange_, with **Turner’s** unique croon adding a wonderfully vibrant element to the track. Also, check out the interview after the acoustic track, in which **Turner** seems rather surprised to learn that he’ll be playing with **Radiohead** at **Coachella**, and admits he hasn’t actually seen the poster. Check out his take on _Strange_ below, and the original under that.\n\n [Alex Turner – Strange (Patsy Cline Cover)](http://soundcloud.com/crackintheroad/alex-turner-strange-patsy) by [crackintheroad](http://soundcloud.com/crackintheroad)\n\nVia [Beats Per Minute](http://beatsperminute.com/media/mp3-alex-turner-arctic-monkeys-strange-patsy-cline-cover/)",
