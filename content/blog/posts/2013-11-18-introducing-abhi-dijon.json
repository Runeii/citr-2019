  "body": "Rapidly spreading across the pages of all the tastemaking blogs, Ellicott City dup **Abhi & Djion** are rapidly proving themselves to be one of the hottest new names in R&B.\n\nHaving previously released an [instrumental EP](http://ooohatsformen.bandcamp.com/) of Dilla-channeling beats, **Dijon** has teamed up with **Abhi** for an EP due out early next year, and their Soundcloud showcases just a whiff of what we might be expecting from the release. Chopped samples, slick vocals, and beats that wouldn’t have been out of place on Jai Paul’s ‘leaked’ demo album, this duo are going to kick up quite the fuss in 2014. Check out T.M and They below, and head over to [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/abhidijon) to hear more.",
