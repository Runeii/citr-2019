  "body": "**Billie Marten** has one of those special voices, and by that I mean when people speak of Adele, Sam Smith and Chris Martin as having special voices, you can comfortably put her alongside them.\n\nThis beautiful cover of Sara Bareilles and Ingrid Michaelson’s _Winter Song_ is perfect for those cold nights when the weather is well and truly against you. Tea in hand, two thousand words of my dissertation prep left to do, and there couldn’t be a more ideal soundtrack. Check it out below, and pick it up from [Daisy Digital’s](https://daisydigital.bandcamp.com/) It’s Coming on Christmas compilation.",
