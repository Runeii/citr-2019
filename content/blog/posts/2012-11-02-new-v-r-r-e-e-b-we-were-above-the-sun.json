  "body": "**V R R E E B** (an anagram of REVERB, clever, huh?) are the latest act attempting to bring about a much needed shoegaze revival, dubbed nu-gaze by critics.\n\nWaves of **Slowdive** inspired guitars with unrefined vocals plastered hazily over the top, it’s anthemic in a way that early shoegaze could only have dreamed of. Four minutes isn’t much to go on, but it’s certainly a worthwhile outing from the UK based group. Check it out below.",
