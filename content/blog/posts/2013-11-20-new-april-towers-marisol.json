  "body": "We first featured April Towers back in August, with the release of their fantastic debut track ‘Tel Aviv’ shedding the first light on Nottingham’s newest electronic duo.\n\nAfter a period of radio silence, they have returned to the furor with their follow up effort entitled ‘Marisol’.\n\nCementing what we believe will become a hallmark of April Tower’s music, ‘Marisol’ begins rather unassumingly with a simple beat and vocal line. Instantly engaging, the track then builds into a blossoming pop frenzy, as additional percussion is introduced and classic pop melodies are translated into infectious piano and synth lines.\n\nIt is very easy to imagine ‘Marisol’ as an anthemic hit, cut as a three minute gem that balances a fine set of dynamics that allow for moments of calming rest bite and shocks of effervescent euphoria. Though they may have flown under the radar of most ‘One’s to Watch’ lists, we’ll certainly be keeping an eye on April Towers in 2014.",
