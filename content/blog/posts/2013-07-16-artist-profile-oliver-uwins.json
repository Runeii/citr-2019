  "body": "Oliver Uwins’ kinetic sculptures use modern day machines positioned, balanced, clamped and gaffer taped together to create the illusion of grainy, otherworldly film footage.\n\nQuite literally using science to create fiction.\n\nThe ‘Rube Goldberg’-esq[\\[1\\]](#_ftn1) machines at first have a look of engineered pointlessness, but upon closer inspection as you peer, squat next to and move around the constructions- you come to realise the beauty behind the combinations. The various pieces of scanners, decks, lamps, stands and coils- spin, shake and connect, to create the beautiful, ephemeral sci-fi imagery shown on screen.\n\nSwitching between the miniature camera points around the piece, the monitor displays what at first looks like a sparkling sky, turning out be a product of light bulbs swinging behind a piece of strategically place holey black card.\n\nWith elements of Pipilotti Rist- the mix of technology and magic is mesmerising; you become transfixed watching things whirr and connect, waiting for the results on screen. The piece slowly reveals it’s own workings out to you, and it’s fascinating to watch.\n\n#gallery-1 { margin: auto; } #gallery-1 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } #gallery-1 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-1 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } /\\* see gallery\\_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php \\*/\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Oliver-Uwins-Inside-Your-TV1-150x150.jpeg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/23080-artist-profile-oliver-uwins/attachment/oliver-uwins-inside-your-tv-2)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Oliver-Uwins-Science-Fiction-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/23080-artist-profile-oliver-uwins/attachment/oliver-uwins-science-fiction)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Oliver-Uwins-Science-Fiction-2-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/23080-artist-profile-oliver-uwins/attachment/oliver-uwins-science-fiction-2)\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Oliver-Uwins-Science-Fiction-3-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/23080-artist-profile-oliver-uwins/attachment/oliver-uwins-science-fiction-3)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Oliver-Uwins-150x150.png)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/23080-artist-profile-oliver-uwins/attachment/oliver-uwins)\n\n  \n\nSee more of his work [here](http://www.olieye.co.uk/).\n\n[\\[1\\]](#_ftnref1) intentionally over-engineered machine that performs a very simple task in a very complex manner, usually including a chain reaction.",
