  "body": "This technically isn’t new, especially to **Kiran Leonard** himself who first wrote **Port-Ainé **when he was in his early teens.\n\nNow at the mighty old age of 18, Kiran is set to release his debut album, **Bowler Hat Soup**, through the wonderful **Hand of Glory Records**, and the brilliant **Port-Ainé **is due out as a single from the album.\n\nKiran’s lyrical ability is outstanding, however what truly makes his music staggeringly special is his method of weaving precise dynamics into his tracks. **Port-Ainé **is ideal evidence of this, as the track’s undulating tempo allows for aching moments of emotional fragility to be coupled with thrusts of resurgent percussion.\n\nYou can pre-order **Bowler Hat Soup **[here](http://handofglory.bigcartel.com/product/kiran-leonard-bowler-hat-soup), and we wholeheartedly recommend you do so.",
