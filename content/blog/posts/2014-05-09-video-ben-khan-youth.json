  "body": "Having already cemented his position as one of the artists of the year, through the release of his fantastic debut EP, 1992, 21 year old **Ben Khan** has released trippy visuals for EP standout _Youth_.\n\nAs delirious and devilishly intriguing as the song itself, it seemingly draws influences from 80’s horror flicks, providing an uneasy, yet immersive watch. Directed by [BRTHR](http://www.brthrfilms.com/) (Foster The People, Charli XCX, Klaxons), it’s a fitting accompaniment to one of 2014’s best tracks.",
