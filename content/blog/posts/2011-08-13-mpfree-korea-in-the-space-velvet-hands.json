  "date": "2011-08-13T00:25:42",
  "body": "This psychedelic lo-fi number comes courtesy of the elusive and bizarrely named **Korea In The Space**.\n\nWith the summer weather seemingly well and truly behind us, let _Velvet Hands_ transport your consciousness to a tranquil, sandy beach, complete with somnolent palm trees and the imperceptible hum of the harmonious ocean. Reverb laden vocals, reminiscent of **Panda Bear** dominant the antecedent section of the track, whilst midway through the vocals fade out and the addictive guitar-drum combo takes the wheel. Stream and download _Velvet Hands_ below, and oh, if you happen across any more information on this enigmatic artist, then let us know!\n\n<a href=\"http://koreainthespace.bandcamp.com/track/velvet-hands\">Velvet Hands by Korea in the Space</a>",
