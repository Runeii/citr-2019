  "body": "Having already collaborated with Soulwax through releases under her own name, Charlotte Adigéry aka **WWWater** steps out with her debut track under the newly birthed moniker.\n\nThe self-titled track serves as a fitting introduction to her twistedly ambitious sound, that manages to feel as much indebted to Portishead or Bjork as it does FKA Twigs, whilst existing entirely within a universe of its own. With more music expected later in the year, alongside live shows across Europe, WWWater is set for a busy next few months. Check out WWWater below.",
