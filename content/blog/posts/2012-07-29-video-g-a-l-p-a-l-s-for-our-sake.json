  "body": "Two adolescent cutesy girls re-enacting every single teenage cliche, soundtracked by three minutes of **Best Coast** style pop… on paper, it’s horrendous.\n\nThankfully, it actually works brilliantly, even if it is bordering open sickly sweet at times. So it’s has it’s tongue placed firmly in it’s cheek, yet that doesn’t stop it being one of the most downright enjoyable tracks of the year thus far. Check out **G A L P A L S** and _For Our Sake_ below.\n\n[G A L P A L S – FOR OUR SAKE](http://vimeo.com/46477936) from [cassandra lee hamilton](http://vimeo.com/cassielee) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
