  "body": "Sometimes when beginning to listen to a new artist, it’s better to cut the bullshit and just listen.\n\nRegardless, context, or at the very least a story of some kind, goes a long way. With **Ra Cailum** I believe I struck the perfect balance. My only frame of reference was two pieces of writing from the man himself. The first was taken from **Cailum**’s bandcamp:\n\n“I recorded this album from January – June 2011. The album is dedicated to Delia. This was her album before it was a Ra Cailum album. Every track on this album was recorded with her, with her instruments, in her house, etc., except for Reminders of You, which I recorded in my home. The album is comprised of Nine memories, a reaction, and a response.\n\nI miss you.”\n\nThe second from his Facebook page as his album dropped, “eh fuck it! Here is the album! I don’t want to wait until tomorrow or Wednesday. I hope you like it!”\n\nIt’s times like this when I get truly excited by the online, digital space in which we now share and enjoy music. The ability to receive an undiluted message from the artist is a rather poignant thing, especially when it comes to an album as emotionally turbulent as this one. At times it dresses itself like an early **Bibio** record, lush acoustic guitars fragment and loop over open spaces and rich ambience. In others it pushes the envelope of what a dark beat driven album can achieve. But free from genres and waves, _Bite Marks_ is what it fucking is; it’s raw, uncompromised and audacious. Perhaps like Delia herself.\n\n<a href=\"http://racailum.bandcamp.com/album/bite-marks\">Bite Marks by Ra Cailum</a>",
