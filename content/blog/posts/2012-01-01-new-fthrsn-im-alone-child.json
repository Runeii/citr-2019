  "body": "Fairly fitting for the first post of 2012, this new track from Ann Arbor based musician **fthrsn** is a gorgeously delicate affair and a perfect hangover cure if I’ve ever heard one.\n\n_I’m Alone Child_ is a five minute heartbreaker, complete with strained vocals and sparklingly elegant synths, all tied up by the generally beautiful atmosphere created by **fthrsn**. Initially intended to be on his _**Hysteria EP**_ from last year, but _I’m Alone Child_ wasn’t finished in time for the release. With this new track, **fthrsn** is setting the marker high for what is sure to be a fantastic year for him.\n\n [Fthrsn – I’m Alone Child](http://soundcloud.com/crackintheroad/fthrsn-im-alone-child) by [crackintheroad](http://soundcloud.com/crackintheroad)\n\nvia ([Speaker Snacks](http://speakersnacks.com/2011/12/fthrsn-im-alone-child/))",
