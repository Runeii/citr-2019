The lyrics are simple yet effective, however the beauty lies within the chorus, one of the finest I’ve heard this year; _‘Way out to sea, they’re looking for me, till I find my way to dry land’._ With a few thousand views on Youtube already, and the track now available via [bandcamp](http://thedistnce.bandcamp.com/track/dry-land) on a pay what you like basis, I get the feeling that it won’t be long before **The Distnce** are generating the buzz that _Dry Land_ deserves.",
