  "body": "**The Harpoons** are one of those ‘if the world were a fair place these guys would be the biggest band in the world’ acts for me.\n\nHaving released one of the tracks of the year a few months back in the form of Do You Want My Love, the Melbourne quartet are back with _Reassurance_, another dance infused number. There’s a real underlying soulful kick to their music that makes it so downright addictive, almost reminding me of elements on the classic first Disclosure record. Check it out below.",
