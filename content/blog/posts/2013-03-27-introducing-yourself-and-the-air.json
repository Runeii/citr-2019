  "body": "Ah Portland, the home of the 60’s revivalists.\n\nKiller hooks, insanely danceable melodies and an ever young air of nonchalance are just a few of the characteristics that seem to be embodied by so much of the exciting music emerging from Oregon. **Yourself And The Air**, a trio comprised of Erick Crosby, Drew Rasmussen and Jeff Papendorf, may well be one of Portlands finest exports in recent years, and their newest release, the ten track **_Spirit Mixers_** showcases exactly why.\n\nCarefree, youthful and exuberant, **Spirit Mixers** draws from the likes of The Beach Boys as much as it does from Gang Of Four or for an even more modern comparison, to the electrifying, perfectly shambolic pop tracks conjured up by **Mac DeMarco**. Whilst there’s clearly not the same budget nor industry figures pushing **Yourself And The Air**, I hesitate to say that if this record makes it into the right ears, the trio could be in for a very rewarding year. Check out the record in full below, or if you’re short on time, pick out my personal favourites, _Bermuda Shorts_ and _Young Luxury_.",
