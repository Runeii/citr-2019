  "body": "With [a website](http://t-a-b-l-o-i-d.tumblr.com/) that’s almost as annoying as it is quirky, **Tabloid\\_** invite viewers to ‘send anonymous tips to tabloid@tvstar.com. Quite what they mean by ‘tips’ is anyone’s guess, however judging by the content of the page one would assume gossip, as oppose to financial tips. With no identities, no location and no social media sites bar the Tumblr itself, **Tabloid\\_** are playing the ultimate game of hidden identities (hey, maybe I know who they are, but let’s play the game for a while…). Their debut track, _Voyeur_, is groovy, R&B number, in the vein of The Neighbourhood, that weirdly, fits in with the flashing, garish imagery of their website.",
