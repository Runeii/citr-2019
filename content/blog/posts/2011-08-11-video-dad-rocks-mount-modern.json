It’s called **_Mount Modern_** and the video for its opening title track can be found below. On the track, **Albertsson** couples the ghostly trumpet and innovative vocal lines **Mimas** devotees have come to know and love with intricate fingerpicking, delicate piano, and aching strings to create a beautiful teaser that has excited for the full length. And all set to a watercolour and ink stop-motion video with a wolf and a paper aeroplane in it, by Jollan Aurelio of **[Heister](http://www.myspace.com/heistertheband \"Heister myspace\")**.
