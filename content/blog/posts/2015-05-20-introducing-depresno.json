  "body": "Having previously produced the likes of Royksopp Datarock and Kings of Convience, the beautiful city of Bergen in Norway is blossoming once again.\n\nWith AURORA going down a storm across Europe right now, it seems likely that seventeen year old **dePresno** is likely to follow in her footsteps. His wistful debut track, **Forever**, feels like the missing connection between Jack Garratt and King Krule; innovative, unique and utterly enthralling. Alternating effortlessly between acoustic and electronic parts, it’s indication of an artist with a very bright future.\n\nFollow our [Spotify On Repeat playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a hand-picked selection of the current hottest tracks.",
