  "body": "So the opening fifteen seconds or so of this new track from London’s **Cub Scout** could well be taken directly from **James Blake’s** disappointing debut LP, but don’t let that put you off.\n\n_Seconds_ soon spreads it’s wings and unveils itself as a sumptuously delicate garage inspired number, twisting marvelously throughout it’s four and a half minute run time. Barely audible female vocals shimmer splendidly over a minimal, repetitive dubstep influenced beat, building up to the track really kicking in around the two minute mark. Check out _Seconds_ below.  \n [Seconds](http://soundcloud.com/cubscoutmusic/seconds) by [CUB SCOUT](http://soundcloud.com/cubscoutmusic)",
