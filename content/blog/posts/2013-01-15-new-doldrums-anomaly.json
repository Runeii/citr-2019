  "body": "**Doldrums’** _Lesser Evil_ LP, is due out on Feb 25th.\n\nThe first cut to be released from the album, _She is the Wave_, was a manic, fizzy and crumpled dance floor oddity that was as much hard work as it was pleasing on the ear. The next track from the LP is _Anomaly_, a title that **Airick Woodhead** perhaps saw as a statement of intent for the tracks’ blueprint. Listening to the track is as much about arranging the sonic styles and choices yourself, than it is about enjoying them. Sudden choppy and abrupt drumming fills, souring and slightly ugly synth build-ups and clashing pitch shifted vocals are used as seen as paint strokes, all intelligently built up to form something that sounds genuinely original.",
