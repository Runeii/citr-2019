  "body": "Seriously, **Noble Oak** is the most underrated musician in the world at this moment in time.\n\nHaving witnessed his development, from his very first recordings, through to more polished and assured compositions, there’s a jealous part of me that wants his music to remain as a bloggers secret, however with each and every release, the chances of that are growing slimmer and slimmer. With _Thea/Vilde_, his first new material in seven months, he continues to grow into his own sound, one that’s poignant and beautiful in equal measures. Play this to your girlfriend / boyfriend / mom / dad… fuck it, just play it to everyone you know.\n\n_‘if i could look into your eyes i would’_\n\n_Thea/Vilde_ is the first taster from **Noble Oak’s** forthcoming EP, _**Away**_, due out later this year.",
