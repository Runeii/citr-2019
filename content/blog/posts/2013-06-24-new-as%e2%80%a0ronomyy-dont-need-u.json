  "body": "Shout out again to our buddies from [**IYES**](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/artist/iyes/) for putting me onto **as†ronomyy**, and this new R&B inspired jam. Vaguely 70’s sounding in parts, simplistic and playing to the strength of the vocals and connection with the classic guitar riff. At almost six minutes long, it’s ambitious and ultimately rewarding, whilst leaving a feeling that there’s far better still to come from **as†ronomyy**. Check out _Don’t Need U_ below.",
