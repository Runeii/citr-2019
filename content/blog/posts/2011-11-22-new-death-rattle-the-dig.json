London duo **Helen** and **Chris Hamilton** (ex-**That Mouth**) are currently recording under this slightly macabre title, and have just released their debut track, _The Dig_. A dirty, behemoth of a first outing, it’s percussion heavy, yet fairly sparse, relying heavily on the immaculate production of the track. Check out the twisted video for _The Dig_ below, and head over to the **Death Rattle** [bandcamp](http://deathrattle.bandcamp.com/) for a free download.",
