  "body": "I always get a strange sense of pride when an exciting new artist emerges from my hometown of Newcastle.\n\nSo **Doldrum** aka Craig Clarke and Gary Dempsey (with artwork / visuals from Ruth Sheldon, may still be a little rough around the edges, but there’s certainly potential on their two demo tracks, the downbeat _The Sound of My Gun_ and more pop sensitive _The\\_AList_. Whilst the production may lack a big budget (it sounds like they’ve recorded in a bedroom, which I somehow suspect they did), it’s lo-fi pop quite unlike anything else coming from the North East at this moment in time. With a touch more work on their production, and with time on their side, there’s no reason why **Doldrum** can’t be one of the finest acts to emerge from the North East in recent years.",
