Ranging from the relatively experimental (dare I say chillwave inspired) _dusk_, to the ambient beauty of _tokyo_, not forgetting his latest release, _submarine_, a track that a twisted Arthur Beatrice would be proud of; there’s more than enough to suggest that he’s a mightily talented kid. Check out a couple of personal favourites below, and more over at his [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/veyns).",
