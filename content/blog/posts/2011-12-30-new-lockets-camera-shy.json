With it’s dream-pop tendencies and ethereal influences, the vocal driven number has already been featured by our blog bro’s [Lostx3](http://www.lostlostlost.com/2011/12/lockets-camera-shy.html), and I’m certain that the coverage of this gorgeous first cut from Todd and Dani will continue to find it’s way round the internet. For me, _Camera Shy_ really hits it’s top speed when the stunning guitar section comes in at around the three minute mark, elevating it far above being just ‘another chillwave inspired track’. Check out _Camera Shy_ below, and head over to **Lockets** [bandcamp](http://lockets.bandcamp.com/) for a free download.\n\n [Camera Shy](http://soundcloud.com/lockets/camera-shy) by [Lockets](http://soundcloud.com/lockets)",
