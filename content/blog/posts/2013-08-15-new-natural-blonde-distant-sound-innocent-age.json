  "body": "New Orleans outfit **Natural Blonde** explode onto the scene with their duo of debut tracks, _Distant Sound_ and _Innocent Age_.\n\nWith an underlying Wavves hangover, alongside the more melody driven leanings of Wild Nothing, these are two mightily exciting first outings. Whilst there’s no information yet as to the members of Natural Blonde, with the considered artwork, and high quality of these tracks, it’s only matter of time before the New Orleans group reveal themselves. Check out Innocent Age and my personal favourite, Distant Sound below.",
