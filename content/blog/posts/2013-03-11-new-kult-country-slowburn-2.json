  "body": "**Kult Country** have been on the pages of CITR a few times now, and not always met with positivity, I seem to remember being a tad rude about their work in the past.\n\nTheir new cut, _Slowburn_, is thankfully a track I can finally meet with a whole load of praise. Their sound finally has a clear personality; it’s dark, elegantly punctuated Manchester aggravation at its finest.\n\n_Slowburn_ is due out on Manchester’s **Sways Records** on April 19. Check out their upcoming dates below.\n\n15th March – Shacklewell Arms, London, UK  \n23rd March – The Bunker, Manchester, UK  \n31st March – Detestival, Sheffield, UK  \n20th April – Soup Kitchen, Manchester, UK  \n14th-16th June – Rockorama, Toulon, FR",
