Recording, producing and releasing his first album by his own means with money that he won from a Radio competition, Shad has always been known as one of the hardest working rappers out there. His style is sometimes compared to that of K-os and Common, especially the content of his lyrics, which are often self-deprecating but also cover many political and social issues. I’ll Never Understand, a track from his self released 2005 first album When This Is Over which focuses on the Rwandan genocide and features poetry read by his mother, documenting her experiences. Fusing emotional lyrics with clever beats, Shad is one of the cleverest rappers around and has produced two of the best hip hop albums of the 00s. Having just announced a new album, titled TSOL scheduled for release on 25 May, I am extremely excited for what Shad will release in the future.\n\n[Shad K – I Get Down](http://www.mediafire.com/?ethzgmmn2wj)\n\n[http://www.shadk.com/](http://www.shadk.com/)",
