  "body": "A few months ago now, a drugged out trap tune from Brighton based producer, **character**, turned more than a few ears when it dropped into our collective inbox.\n\nThe track was entitled _Tribe ii, i_. It centred on some intense sampled chants and scatted percussion, but with the rest of the tracks elements seemingly concocted out of wizardry, it felt like a pretty fucking honest response to trap and heavier forms of bass music. It was different; lets just leave it at that.\n\nThe follow up, a remix of **saol álainn**’s nostroke, establishes a firm and as of yet tactful approach to tone. Character’s cuts go hard, but it’s with a steady and thoughtful arm we’re guided to a shore. In _nostroke_, he strips the life from the original track, revealing something quite overwhelming.",
