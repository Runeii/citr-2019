  "date": "2013-03-27T14:42:29",
  "body": "Reportedly featuring members of **WU LYF** (Tom, Joseph and Evans) alongside members of **FAMY** and **Profondo**, **Los Porcos** are resoundingly upbeat.\n\nTheir debut tracks, _Do You Wanna Live?_ and _Jesus Luvs U Baby_ are 70’s throwbacks, with echo’s of classic early 00’s R&B; it’s funky and despite the general tongue in cheek feel of the whole thing, it’s undoubtedly a match made in heaven. Almost gleeful sounding, it’s insincere in an Ariel Pink, Mac DeMarco manner, and you know what, it’s bloody fantastic. Check out both tracks below.",
