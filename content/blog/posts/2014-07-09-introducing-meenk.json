  "body": "Austin is one of my favourite cities in the world.\n\nNot only does it now hold two weeks worth of SXSW memories and countless friends, but it’s also one of the top places for emerging music. **Meenk**, the project of May Rio, a graduate of [Rhode Island School of Design](http://www.may-rio.com/about/), is further proof that there’s something in the Texan water. Debut EP, **_Scamu Scau_** is a lyrical masterclass; across four tracks of a gloriously lo-fi nature, it’s full of a personality that’s cutting, sarcastic and brilliantly down to earth. From personal favourite, _19_, to EP opener _Reasons,_ it’s comfortably one of my favourite EPs of the year thus far. Check out all four tracks below, and pick up the EP on [Bandcamp](http://meenk.bandcamp.com/).",
