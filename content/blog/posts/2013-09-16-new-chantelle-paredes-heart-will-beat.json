  "date": "2013-09-16T17:37:38",
  "body": "Given that I’ve lost half my hearing after a gig last night, this new track from California’s **Chantelle Paredes** is pretty much perfect listening right now.\n\n_Your Heart Will Beat You_ is a gorgeous, spectacularly considered slice of **Zola Jesus** / **M83** dream-pop. Paredes’s angelic, soothing vocals float mystically over a tenderly played pipe organ, as the song builds to it’s layered crescendo. Check out _Your Heart Will Beat You_ below.",
