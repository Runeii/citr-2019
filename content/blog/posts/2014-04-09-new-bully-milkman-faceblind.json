  "body": "Having now sold out two prints of their self-titled debut EP, and proving to be one of the must see artists at SXSW, Nashville’s **Bully** are well and truly on the rise.\n\nThey’ve just made their new 7″ available to pre-order, featuring two new tracks, _Milkman_ and _Faceblind_, with the A-side showing off their raw, beautifully unrefined edge. On the flip-side, Faceblind appears more composed, yet equally as exciting. On the strength of these two tracks, and their debut EP, **Bully** are one of the most impressive new bands in the world right now.",
