His last EP, **_[Soul Damage](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/10164-introducing-apache-jackson/ \"Introducing: Apache Jackson\")_**, really took us all of guard. It was a quietly disturbing array of Rn’B jams that tested ones nerves as well as the grooves in ones limbs. His new track, **_Iced Milk_**, perhaps explains the time in hiatus. Not only is the record tonally more succinct, but the pace and structure of the track lends far greater to the narratives **Jackson** seeks to explore.
