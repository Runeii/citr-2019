  "body": "They were the first band in ‘many years’ to record a live session for **BBC Radio 1**‘s **Steve Lamacq** whilst still being unsigned, and recorded a majority of their first album at an Industrial Steam Museum.\n\nTherefore when **Crack in the Road** got the opportunity to interview **Goldheart Assembly**, we found a band that was as original and engaging in their music as they were in their topical banter.\n\nGreeted by their audacious Tour Manager threatening to wee into lead vocalist **John Herbert**‘s shoe, I immediately realised this would not, thankfully, be a straight forward Q and A. After this initial weak bladder induced threat passed, **Goldheart Assembly** rather modestly admitted they were surprised that **Academy 2 ‘was packed’** during their set, but highlighted that **Dot-To-Dot** allowed fans to move from venue to venue with ease to make the most of the bands on show. However the band said this was entirely different from their recent **Camden Crawl** experience, where **‘fans were too scared to leave a venue’** incase they were stuck in inevitable and never ending queues. This enjoyment of the free spirited nature within **Dot-To-Dot** was echoed in the band’s origins, who **‘started singing together for a laugh’** and by **‘doing gigs in central London, and as a result we grew out of  a collective of bands’**. Such honest and casual beginnings remain distinct in a band that is now constantly being tipped as the ‘next big thing’; a claim that is validated by the fact that **Goldheart Assembly** are opening the **BBC Radio 1/NME Stage** on the Saturday (Leeds) and Sunday (Reading). However while we can all get excited about the potential of lofty successes, **Goldheart Assembly** also revealed that their worst gigging experience came in the form of **‘driving seven hours to Aberdeen to play to two people ‘.** They made us aware that this sort of event was by no means a one off, and perhaps it is this organic and slow formation that has moulded **Goldheart Assembly** into the eclectic and genuine musical collective that it is. **John Herbert** revealed that his personal major influence was American dream pop trio **Galaxie 500**, and while you can hear some of that come through in **Goldheart Assembly**‘s music, it also demonstrates how many other influences have infused the unique sound they have managed to create.\n\nThe fortunate positioning of a **Pieminister** outlet allowed me to ask the character acid test:\n\nWhat do you think of **Greggs**?\n\nTo my relief there was a resounding positive response, with shouts of ‘**Sausage and Bean Melts are the bollocks’** and **‘Eatable pastry clothes, designed by Greggs!’** There was even an expression of interest in headlining a **Greggs** sponsored music festival, so watch this space!\n\nAn absolute joy to interview and a thoroughly engaging band to listen to, make sure to catch **Goldheart Assembly** at one of their many festival dates across the summer!\n\n[Goldheart Assembly Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/goldheartassembly)\n\n[Dot-To-Dot Festival Review](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/1220-review-dot-to-dot-festival-manchester)",
