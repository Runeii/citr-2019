  "body": "**Henry Jamison’s** debut track, _Real Peach_, has been stuck with me over the past couple of weeks – bizarrely in a way as it’s perhaps not the usual sound I’d go for.\n\nThere’s a tinge of Americana to the songwriting, a genre which if I’m brutally honest, I usually can’t stand – yet it’s the songwriting and the gorgeously saccharine vocal that really got me hooked. A love song at heart, it’s a stark contrast to his second offering, the more melancholic _Through A Glass_. Still rooted amongst folk influences, it’s perhaps less immediate, but no less emotive. Check out both tracks below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
