  "body": "Don’t get on the wrong side of **Lauren Pritchard**.\n\nRevamping her ‘good girl’ image, the twenty five year old former soul singer has adopted a grittier approach, whilst maintaining the stunning vocals that helped her shoot to fame. You can imagine her storming into a room at a house party, half weeping, half yelling new single _Heard It From A Friend_ in the direction of a cheating boyfriend. Raw, cutting and deliriously energetic, having already clocked up an impressive 100,000 plays of her debut track ([_Weapon For Saturday_](www.crackintheroad.com/music/22518-new-lolo-weapon-for-saturday/)), and featured on the recent [**Panic At The Disco**](https://soundcloud.com/panicatthedisco/miss-jackson-feat-lolo) single, **Lolo’s** future is looking extremely bright.",
