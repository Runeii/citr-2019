  "title": "New: Blludd Relations – Even Steven (Micachu Version)",
  "date": "2013-04-19T16:51:53",
  "body": "_Even Stevens_, the first single from the new **Bullion/Jesse Hackett** project **Blludd Relations**, was a fun and colourful pop song.\n\nIt sported a wry, playful smile on its face for the whole of the track’s 4 minutes and 47 seconds – I loved it for that. This **Micachu** reinterpretation, not so fun, but fuck me it great. It chugs along at a sloth’s pace, moans, shuffles and at times is frustrating as hell to listen to – but my god it’s engaging. It might only sound like the original track’s twice-removed cousin, but it’s enough for it to be invited over at Christmas to clutter up the place.\n\nIt gets invited around every year.",
