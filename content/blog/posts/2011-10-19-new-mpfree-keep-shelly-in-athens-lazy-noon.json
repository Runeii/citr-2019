  "date": "2011-10-19T20:58:09",
  "body": "This new track from everyone’s favourite Greek pop duo, **Keep Shelly In Athens**, is set to feature on their upcoming 12″ EP _**Our Own Dream**_.\n\n_Lazy Noon_ is a funky vocal driven affair, with the multi-layered beat proving hypnotically repetitive, serving to lull the listener into a dream inducing state. Imagine **Portishead** pumped with gallons of sugary sweets and anti-depressants, then dolled up in gear from Ann Summers, and you begin to understand the overall feel to the elegantly languid _Lazy Noon_. With what has already been a fantastic year for the duo beginning to draw to a close, the release of **_Our Own Dream_** is only set to bring their sound to an even broader audience.\n\nCheck out _Lazy Noon_ below, and download it for free.\n\n [Keep Shelly in Athens, “Lazy Noon”](http://soundcloud.com/fadermedia/keep-shelly-in-athens-lazy) by [The FADER](http://soundcloud.com/fadermedia)",
