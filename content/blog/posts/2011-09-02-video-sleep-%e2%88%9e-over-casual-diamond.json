  "body": "Austin based songstress **Stefanie Franciotti** aka **Sleep ∞ Over** has just dropped a psychedelic new video for synth dominated track _Casual Diamond_, ahead of her debut full length release _**Forever**_ which will be available towards the end of the month.\n\nIt’s a fairly haunting and threatening video, featuring numerous scenes with sharp knives, sinister hooded figures and distressed dancing.
