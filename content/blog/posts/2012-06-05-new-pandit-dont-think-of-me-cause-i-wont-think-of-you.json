  "body": "As a general rule, I despise anything that references, features or even hints at the excessive use of a harmonica, but hey, rules are made to be broken, right? In the case of this gorgeous ditty from Texan troubadour **Pandit**, the shrill tones of the harmonica snuggle perfectly next to the sultry, melancholic vocals of Lance Smith, working to complete and utter splendor.\n\nTaking a step back from his more ethereal sound experienced on his debut record, _Don’t Think of Me (Cause I Won’t Think Of You)_ is far closer to **Dylan** than to **Pandit’s** contemporaries, and is all the more beautiful for it. _“And when everyone is asking about me, Cause they have no clue what happened really, Don’t think of me, cause I won’t think of you”_",
