Its dusty and woozy samples created a haze of sedation, the samples praying on gentle repetition of samples, while subtle changes in the groove jolt the listener out of a forced trance.\n\nHis latest track, a production credit on **[SiairaShawn’s](http://www.facebook.com/SiairaShawn)** new cut ‘Dusk’, feels like a spiritual progression of his earlier work. Again, the dusty jazz roots sounds are still prevalent, yet **SiairaShawn’s** smooth and surrendering vocals give the whole thing a much more forward thinking feel. This is more than just crate digging.\n\nStream and D/L the new track below.",
