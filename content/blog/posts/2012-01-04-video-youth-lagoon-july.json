  "body": "**Tyler T Williams** has done it again.\n\nHaving [visualized](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/11026-video-youth-lagoon-%E2%80%93-montana/) **Youth Lagoon’s** _Montana_ in such a stirring and tear-inducing way, he’s taken another cut from **_The Year of Hibernation_** and put it to a stunning video. Almost seeming like a sequel to Montana, the beautifully shot clip is again a admirably personal insight into the music of **Trevor Powers** and his hometown of Boise. Capturing the very essence of the fragile elegance of _July_, it’s another in a long line of classics from **Williams**. Check out the clip below, and the dates **Youth Lagoon’s** upcoming tour.\n\n[Youth Lagoon – July](http://vimeo.com/34332459) from [Tyler T Williams](http://vimeo.com/tylertwilliams) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).\n\n01/19: The Crocodile, Seattle  \n01/20: Biltmore, Vancouver  \n01/21: Doug Fir, Portland  \n02/23: Paradiso Upstairs, Amsterdam  \n02/24: Gebäude 9, Koln  \n02/25: Point Ephemere, Paris  \n02/27: Botanique/Rotonde, Brussels  \n02/28: 59 To 1, Munich  \n02/29: Postbahnhof (Small Room), Berlin  \n03/02: Debaser, Stockholm  \n03/03: Vega – Small Room, Copenhagen  \n03/04: Molotow, Hamburg  \n03/06: Electrowerkz, London  \n3/10: Urban Lounge, Salt Lake City  \n3/11: Larimer Lounge, Denver  \n3/12: Jackpot Music Hall, Lawrence  \n3/18: Fitzgerald’s, Houston  \n3/19: One Eyed Jacks, New Orleans  \n3/20: Club Downunder, Tallahassee  \n3/21: The Social, Orlando  \n3/22: Drunken Unicorn, Atlanta  \n3/23: Cat’s Cradle, Carrboro  \n3/24: Rock N Roll Hotel, Washington DC  \n3/26: Union Transfer, Philadelphia  \n3/27: Bowery Ballroom, New York  \n3/28: Music Hall of Williamsburg, Brooklyn  \n3/29: Middle East Downstairs, Cambridge  \n3/30: La Sala Rossa, Montreal  \n3/31: Lee’s Palace, Toronto  \n4/02: Radio Radio, Indianapolis  \n4/03: Firebird, St. Louis  \n4/04: Metro, Chicago  \n4/05: Turner Hall, Milwaukee  \n4/08: Indie O Fest, Mexico City  \n4/11: Porter’s Pub @ UCSD, San Diego  \n4/12: Troubadour, Los Angeles  \n4/13: The Independent, San Francisco",
