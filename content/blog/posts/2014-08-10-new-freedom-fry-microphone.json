  "body": "L.\n\nA duo **Freedom Fry** have cause a bit of a stir in the last couple weeks with their new single _The Wilder Mile_ racking up more than 40,000 plays. They have now released what appears to be the tracks B-Side, _Microphone_, which is what I imagine a more light-hearted and fun Tame Impala would sound like. It’s all jumping guitars and playful vocals and proves that music doesn’t need to be genre defining to be downright enjoyable. Manic synthesizers float in the background and give this track the tongue-in-cheek vibe that make it so loveable. Stream it below, as well as The Wilder Mile.",
