The attitude of ‘sticking a bit of reverb on it and hoping for the best’ has taken over, leaving a lot of contemporary music coming across as fashion music and little else. [**Little Kid**](http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Little-Kid/) does not fall into that trap. Sure his music could be described as Lo-Fi, it is made on a 4-track after all, but beneath the crackles and hisses are beautifully constructed folk numbers, with the background noises only adding to the lonely and introspective atmosphere. He has a 10 song album up for free download, be a star and download it now.\n\n<a href=\"http://littlekid.bandcamp.com/album/logic-songs\">Logic Songs by Little Kid</a>",
