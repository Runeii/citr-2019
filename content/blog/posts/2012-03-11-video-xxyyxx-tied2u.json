  "body": "Music videos hold a strange place on the Internet.\n\nAs an art form that now jostles with all different forms of media, no longer solely witnessed through ore TV screens, it constantly has to argue for our attentions. Most fail, with Facebook, twitter and blogs grabbing our attention after the first watch. The new video from **[XXYYXX](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13444-new-xxyyxx-alone/ \"New: xxyyxx – Alone\")** is the first video in a while which I’ve been compelled to watch, again, and then once more just for luck.\n\nCentered almost entirely on individuals smoking weed, the reversed footage is some of the saddest pieces of film I’ve watched in a while. Each grimace, insecurity and moment of silent pain is drawn out, reminding of that twilight moment between night and morning; a moment of guilt and indulgence.",
