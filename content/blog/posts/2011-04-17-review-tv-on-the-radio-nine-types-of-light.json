Although never strictly political or ‘socially conscious’, there still manages to capture the feelings and motivations of the world around them. It’s almost unexpected then, that apart from this LP, which was record in Los Angeles; all prior material was recorded in Brooklyn. Although _Nine Types Of Light_ isn’t a huge departure from previous material, with the latter half of the album making a clear comparison with _Dear Science’s_ raucous sounds, it still develops a sound that has been simmering under the surface amongst the other tones and textures the band produces.\n\nAt its roots the album is a love album. The group make that very clear with the opening track ‘_Second Song_’, regardless of the well-trodden path they’ve chosen to take, they still manage to consume you in their lives better than most. The track has a wonderful delicacy, thanks mostly to **Tunde Adebimpe’s** vocals, “_confidence and ignorance approve me_” is an honest indication of how the record will play out.\n\nThe track begins is what can roughly be described as a concept album, gently and at times heart wrenchingly, exploring the process of dealing with a loved ones departure. The production suits this perfectly, ‘_Second Song_’ and ‘_Keep your heart_’ gently overflow with their productions, catching a groove while complimenting with ambient strings and rough guitar riffs, it perfectly mirrors the mood.\n\nUltimately though the songs are conservatively written, despite the subtle blemishes within the production that give the record so much life, we have a record that at times follows a familiar path. There are casualties of this, ‘_No Future Shock_’ and ‘_Repetition_’ at times feel predictable, and by the half waypoint the 2 tunes have given all they have to give. In other instances however, they offer a solid way of letting the various tones and themes of the record to really breath. The highlight ‘_Killer Crane_’ is a remarkable example of this, from the opening sober piano chords to the perfectly written chorus, (“_Sunshine I saw you through the hanging vine, A memory of what was mine fading away, But this night heals the, And the moonlight steals the sound, I could leave suddenly unafraid_”), the song gently takes the listener through a complicated and ambivalent healing process in the most stunning of manners.\n\nBy the end of the album we stay into Dear Science’s territory, ‘_Caffeinated Consciousness’_ is a blistering example of the bands range. This isn’t the tone that will be leave with you though, ‘_Will Do_’ the LP’s single sums up the tone perfectly. The chorus “_Any time will do, my love. Any time will do, what choice of words will take me back to you?_” is a composed, hopeful and resilient hook that manages to be rooted in romanticism yet unnervingly realist. _Nine Types Of Light_ manages to explore these ideas effortlessly, something that will no doubt make this album timeless.\n\n [TV On The Radio – Killer Crane](http://soundcloud.com/igamusic/tv-on-the-radio-killer-crane) by [Interscope Records](http://soundcloud.com/igamusic)",
