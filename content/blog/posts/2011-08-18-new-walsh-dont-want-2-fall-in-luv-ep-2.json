  "body": "I’ve had a somewhat mixed relationship with the Knoxville based beat maker [**Walsh**](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Walsh-Tn/158274767519444). His first EP, _**Smoke Weed About It**_, was unearthed gem; combining elements of ambient beat music, instrumental hip-hop and electronica to create something that throbbed with an uncertain yet gravitating energy. It also featured a great featuring slot from **Squadda Bambino**, an MC who should have a great future.\n\nThe EP that followed, [_**Karaoke**_](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/6536-review-walsh-karaoke/ \"Review: WALSH – KARAOKE\"), for me personally, completely lacked personality. Thankfully, the latest offering from **Walsh** really hits the spot. He plays with genre as always, but this time with a purpose, stamping his sound on the styles he seeks to explore.\n\nThe new EP was put up online for streaming yesterday. Check it out below.\n\n [WALSH – Don’t Want 2 Fall In Luv EP](http://soundcloud.com/draculahorse/sets/walsh-dont-want-2-fall-in-luv) by [DRACULA HORSE](http://soundcloud.com/draculahorse)",
