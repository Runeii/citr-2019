  "body": "If 2012 is know for one thing, and one thing alone, which frankly seems unreasonable, it’s likely to be remembered for some killer hip-hop.\n\nGreat news for music lovers, but slightly shittier news for artists desperately hustling for the attentions of bloggers and labels. LA natives **[Shadowrunners Click](https://www.facebook.com/shadowrunnersclick)** find themselves firmly lumped into the ‘overlooked’ category, despite a steady release of solid material leading up to their Mixtape’s release. Sitting neatly between the cloud rap of **Cities Aviv** and the wacky flows of **Das Racist**, it’s actually an increasingly pleasant distraction from a year of hip-hop that almost exclusively took itself too seriously.",
