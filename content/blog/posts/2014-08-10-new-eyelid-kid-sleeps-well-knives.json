  "body": "California’s **Eyelid Kid** impressed on their debut track, [Time Travel](http://admin.</p><p>crackintheroad.com/music/27935-new-eyelid-kid-time-travel), and are now back with another slice of perfectly crafted indie-pop. _Sleeps Well On Knives_ is part Vampire Weekend, part The Shins and 100% made for festival crowds, and not only that, but really feels like the beginning of something rather special for Eyelid Kid.
