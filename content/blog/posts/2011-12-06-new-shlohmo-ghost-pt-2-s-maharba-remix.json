Easily one of my favourite producers around at the moment, this new remix of LA electro-folk artist **Shlohmo** is just another in a long line of refreshingly original pieces. Splicing the track almost beyond recognition, whilst maintaining a downbeat soulful vibe, _Ghost Pt. 2_ may just be the track to soundtrack your New Year. With more material expected in 2012, **S.Maharba** is finally beginning to garner the sort of praise that he has deserved for so long.
