So, unravel your best pair of headphones, put the wrapping paper to one side, and brace yourself for the ultimate rundown of the best albums of 2011.\n\n#50 **The Weeknd** – _**House of Balloons**_\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/TheWeeknd_HouseOfBalloons.jpg \"The Weeknd - House of Balloons\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13225-albums-of-the-year-2011-50-41/attachment/theweeknd_houseofballoons/)\n\nThe first of **Abel Tesfaye’s** three releases this year was also his strongest. Combining his unique slick, ever-so sleazy R’n’B style with immaculate production values, it’s no surprise that **The Weeknd** has since been recruited by the likes of **Drake**, **Florence** and **Lady Gaga**. JD\n\n#49 **James Pants** – **_James Pants_**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/James-Pants.jpg \"James Pants\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13225-albums-of-the-year-2011-50-41/attachment/james-pants/)\n\nWith his third album, renowned multi-instrumentalist **James Pants** enhanced his reputation as one of the finest producers around at the moment. Grounded amongst hip-hop beats, the self-titled LP delves into 80’s pop and 70’s soul inspirations, forming his most accomplished release to date. JD\n\n#48 **Laura Marling** – _**A Creature I Don’t Know**_\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/51Aa6LYeiWL.jpg \"Laura Marling - A Creature I Don't Know\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13225-albums-of-the-year-2011-50-41/attachment/51aa6lyeiwl/)\n\nHaving been nominated for the Mercury Prize with her two previous albums, **Marling’s** third attempt was her most eagerly anticipated to date. Showcasing her ever maturing songwriting skills and elegant vocals, _**A Creature I Don’t Know**_ lurches between sedately soothing and volatile and passionate. JD\n\n#47 **Slow Club** – _**Paradise**_\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/SlowClubParadise.jpg \"Slow Club - Paradise\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13225-albums-of-the-year-2011-50-41/attachment/slowclubparadise/)\n\nIn September, folk duo **Slow Club** released long awaited sophomore record _**Paradise**_, to widespread acclaim. Firmly attacking the twee labels attracted by debut _**Yeah So?**_, the album displays a maturity and bravery in its minimalism, whilst retaining the delicate vocal chemistry that has come to represent their unique appeal. WT\n\n#46 **Balam Acab** – _**Wander / Wonder**_\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/balam-acap-wander-wonder-20111.jpeg \"Balam Acab - Wander / Wonder\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13225-albums-of-the-year-2011-50-41/attachment/balam-acap-wander-wonder-2011-2/)\n\nWitch house was so 2011. Not only is _**Wander/Wonder**_ **Alec Koone’s** best record yet, it set him high above his ruddy moody contemporaries. AY\n\n#45 **tUnE-yArDs** – _**w h o  k i l l**_\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/61hjESmo94L.jpg \"tUnE-yArDs - w h o  k i l l\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13225-albums-of-the-year-2011-50-41/attachment/61hjesmo94l/)\n\nOdd-pop musician **Merrill Garbus** and her solo project **tUnE-yArDs** fashioned one of the most sonically diverse records of 2011. Flipping between bizarrely uplifting pop tracks and more soulful numbers, _**w h o  k i l l**_ is the most enjoyable yet intimidating album of the year. JD\n\n#44 **Young Montana?** – **_Limerence_**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Limerence.jpg \"Young Montana? - Limerence\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13225-albums-of-the-year-2011-50-41/attachment/limerence/)\n\n**Jon Pritchard’s** debut record _**Limerence**_ proves a vibrant combination of 90’s hip-hop and contemporary dance music. Remixing for and touring with **WU LYF** has deservedly brought his music to a larger audience. JD\n\n#43 **EMA** – _**Past Life Martyred Saints**_\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/past-life-martyred-saints.jpg \"EMA - Past Life Martyred Saints\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13225-albums-of-the-year-2011-50-41/attachment/past-life-martyred-saints/)\n\nWith lead single _California_ creating a stir on the internet due to it’s gritty, inescapable honesty, **Erika M. Anderson’s** debut solo LP again drew the plaudits. Past Life Martyred Saints combines the angst of a disillusioned twenty-something with the fragility that only real-life experience can harness. JD\n\n#42 **Peaking Lights** – **_936_**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Peaking-Lights-936-cover1.jpg \"Peaking Lights - 936\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13225-albums-of-the-year-2011-50-41/attachment/peaking-lights-936-cover-2/)\n\nOne of the surprise LP’s of the year, _**936**_ by **Peaking Lights** has popped up in numerous end of year lists, and quite rightly so. With a tip of the hat to the likes of **The XX** and **Warpaint**, **Peaking Lights** create an atmosphere entirely their own, with a record that’s as modest as it is extravagant. JD\n\n#41 **Tyler, The Creator** – **_GOBLIN_**\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Tyler-The-Creator-Goblin.jpg \"Tyler The Creator - Goblin\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13225-albums-of-the-year-2011-50-41/attachment/tyler-the-creator-goblin/)\n\n**Odd Future** figurehead **Tyler, The Creator** released his major label debut _**GOBLIN**_ in May, preceded by ambitious single _Yonkers_. As offensive as it is unique and containing several particularly strong tracks, it’s sadly prevented from reaching truly memorable status by it’s immaturity and youthful inexperience. JD",
