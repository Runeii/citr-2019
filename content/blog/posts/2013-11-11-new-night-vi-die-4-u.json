  "body": "London six piece **The Night VI** aren’t afraid of taking on the classics, having previously covered the likes of Stardust, Buckley and Marvin Gaye, they’ve also tried their hand at **Prince’s** _I Would Die 4 U._\n\nMore expansive and confident sounding than their own originals, their version of I Would Die 4 U feels more like it’s lifted from the **White Lies** cover than the original, not that that’s a bad thing at all.",
