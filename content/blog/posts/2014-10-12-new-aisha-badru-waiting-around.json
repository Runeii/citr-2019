  "body": "A few weeks ago I stumbled across an EP uploaded on Bandcamp from New York’s **Aisha Badru**, however within a couple of hours, all trace of the release had disappeared.\n\nThis debut outing, the first uploaded to her [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/aishabadru) page, is a gorgeously textured acoustic number, a song that’s as heart-wrenchingly honest as any other you’ll hear this year. Check out _Waiting Around_ below, and purchase it on [Bandcamp](http://aishabadru.bandcamp.com/releases).",
