  "body": "Gaps in-between letters are so 2012, just ask SOHN and MONEY.\n\nIn fact, Swedish outfit **Y O U T H C U L T** certainly sound like they’ve spent a decent amount of time with the music of MONEY, and WU LYF for that matter, with their brooding, epic uplifting debut EP. Controversially titled _**Y O U T H C U N T**_ (see what they did there?), it’s four tracks of shrieked vocals, solemn piano ballads and a harrowing sense of despair. Check out EP opener, _May Be Myopic_ and _In The Dark_ below, then stream the full four track release underneath that.",
