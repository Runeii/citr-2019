So they look like they’re probably still in high school and there’s more than a hint of Purity Ring to _Fugitives_, their debut track, however once you get over that comparison, there’s something about their songwriting that’s mildly intoxicating. Delicate female vocals and sombre clicks glide mystically over the chillwave inspired synths. So maybe I downplayed the Purity Ring similarities _ever so_ slightly, but c’mon, they’re still learning, and G(h)OST are just oozing with _potential_.",
