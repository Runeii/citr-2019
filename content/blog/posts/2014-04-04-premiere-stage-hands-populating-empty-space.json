  "body": "As much as I love the new generation of self-proclaimed ‘bedroom producers’, there can be an underlying feeling that a certain proportion of it is rather forced, even verging on unemotionally rigid.\n\n**Stage Hands**, the moniker of Pennsylvania’s Brandon Locher and Gerald Mattis appears to work towards the opposite goal, creating soundscapes that whilst have their roots within electronica and even psychedelic dance, yet pulsate with a far more organic vibe. New track, The Populating Of Empty Space is simultaneously as otherworldly and alien as possible, with it’s unique textures and intricate composition, although the core of the track retains the vibrancy of more traditionally written music. Check it out below.",
