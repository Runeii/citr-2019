Performing at both London and Glasgow dates of **Stag and Dagger**, they are sure to generate positive reviews from the huge numbers of media critics attending. Taking inspiration from such a wide range of talent, including **Primal Scream**, **Talking Heads** and **Public Enemy;** **Django Django** create free flowing, melodic math rock songs, a perfect example being most recently single _Wor_, which builds upon the edgy guitar riffs which Foals so spectaculary brought back into fashion in 2008.\n\n[Listen to Wor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRakWS5NnZc)\n\n[Check Out Their Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/djangotime)\n\n[Buy Tickets For Stag And Dagger](http://www.staganddagger.com/)",
