As well as this fantastic experience, the music is also top quality, brought to you by Dublin’s finest, and as if that wasn’t enough, tickets for **Stag and Dagger** are avaliable for half price from the official Diesel store in Glasgow.\n\n[Buy Tickets For Stag And Dagger](http://www.staganddagger.com/)",
