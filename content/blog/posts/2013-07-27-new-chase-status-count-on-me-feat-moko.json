  "date": "2013-07-27T14:08:34",
  "body": "I’ll be honest, I’m not huge on **Chase & Status**, but this track featuring our girl **Moko** is pretty special.\n\nWith a rapidly growing fanbase, and rumours of a record deal having been signed, you can expect to be hearing **Moko’s** name A LOT more over the coming months. There’s a real old school vibe to _Count On Me_, whilst fitting perfectly into the ‘club-ready’ bracket. Check out _Count On Me_ below, released 29 September.",
