  "body": "**[Youthfall’s](http://www.facebook.com/Youthfall)** last release **[_Secular Child_](http://soundcloud.com/youthfall/secular-child)** criminally passed by many major blogs after it dropped a few weeks ago, that’s not to say it didn’t get attention, more that it should have received a lot more. I say that with a lump in my throat, as **CITR** was in fact one of those blogs. We were all ashamed and didn’t speak for weeks. The events that followed however gifted us a chance to redeem ourselves in the form of track premiere.\n\nCITR has never had a complex when it comes to exclusives, (mostly as we have an editor and chief who has a fascination with writing about artists with only one-ten fans on facebook), but when it came to Youthfall we couldn’t say no. The twin brother duo’s new track **_‘Guard it like a Fortress’_**, strikes a fascinating balance between lo-fi trends and good old fashioned pop-song writing. What’s important to state, is that style is always secondary to substance, which perhaps makes the style of the track so striking. It’s delicate and boyish pop at its finest and a wonderful addition to their work.\n\nStream and download the track below.",
