  "date": "2013-06-25T12:20:44",
  "body": "Rumours of the return of enigmatic WU LYF frontman Ellery Roberts have been bubbling away for a while now.\n\nWith Los Porcos, Francis Lung and Ménage á Trois carving out their own life beyond LYF, **Ellery James Roberts** has returned with the blistering anthemic _Kerou’s Lament_. In truth, it’s not too far from the organ heavy, wistful sound of WU LYF, and the vocals are as despairingly torn as ever. Where _**Go Tell Fire To The Mountain**_ was a call to arms, Kerou’s Lament is the devastating aftermath, as the dust settles, and those that survived pull themselves out from underneath the debris.\n\n“to the powers of old/  \nto the powers that be/  \nyou have fucked up this world/  \nbut you wont fuck with me”\n\nCheck out the video below, and grab a free download from [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/kerou/lament).",
