  "body": "**Flatsound** knows how to cut right to the core.\n\nWhether he’s waxing lyrical about sexual fetishes or as in this case, the emotional attachment to his mother, **Mitch Welling** has the rare gift of portraying a magnificent connection between the music and real life. With a new album soon, he’s released a short teaser containing six tracks that are, in his own words, the product of one night recording directly to cassette.
