  "date": "2012-01-30T17:12:00",
  "body": "Hailing from Cork, Ireland, electro-pop duo [**Young Wonder**](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Young-Wonder/181370401949785?sk=wall) are set to release their debut EP in mid April, preceded by lead single _Tumbling Backwards_. As the first signing to Media Production company turned record label **[Feel Good Lost](http://www.facebook.com/FeelGoodLostMedia)**, it’s a stellar introduction to both projects. Taking from dance and trance influences, it’s heavy on the side-chain compression and reverb drenched vocals, conjuring up a majestic and mystical atmosphere in which the track elegantly twists and pirouettes. Check out _Tumbling Backwards_ below, and download it for free.",
