  "body": "Artwork by **[Bonapetit](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bonapetit/)**\n\nFor a sound so blissfully soulful, [**Apache Jackson**’s](http://apachejackson.bandcamp.com/) music is unnervingly intimidating. Grabbing influences from Rn’B and 80’s infused pop, the new EP, _Soul Damage_, emits a claustrophobic and deranged energy. Drums hiss and reverberate, Jackson’s desolate tones seem to stretch on infinitely into the night and the grooves that give structure to the open spaces, are maddeningly punctuated.\n\nLittle is know about the man behind the music, apart from his links with the city of Portland, hopefully we’ll be hearing more from this exciting artist soon.",
