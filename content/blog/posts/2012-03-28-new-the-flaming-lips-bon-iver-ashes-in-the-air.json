Far from any bog standard vinyl re-release, it’s a full-sized compilation album featuring guest appearances from artists all the way from **Nick Cave** to **Ke$ha** – and here we have the first look at one of the brand new tracks off that album. With a guest appearance from **Bon Iver**, this track is very much **Justin Vernon** adapting to the style of **Coyne** and co, rather than vice versa. It’s a seriously awesome little song that not only demonstrates that **The Flaming Lips** are (once again) progressing on from their _Embryonic_ sound, but are also actually putting the effort in to releasing an genuinely well-made full album next month – which is something to get pretty damned excited about.",
