  "body": "London based producer Ikonika returns with new track _Manual Decapitation _in the lead up to her new album Distractions.\n\nThe song itself is far more accessible than its name might suggest. The opening synth arpeggio is reminiscent of Flume’s recent track Enough featuring Pusha T, but manages to retain a smooth eerie sound throughout in contrast to Flume’s more abrasive choice of tone. The inclusion of bells and ghostly vocals that sit low in the mix give the track a real sense of depth, while the subtle changes Ikonika plays with in the synths keeps the songs emotional tonality in constant fluctuation. Check out the beautiful Manual Decapitation below.",
