  "body": "**Libby Thompson’s** debut EP, _h(E)l(P)_ is a bizarre, intoxicating listen, seemingly unsure of it’s strengths yet stoically confident in the overall ability.\n\nTwisted electronica, fused with elements of modern dance music, all set against Thompson’s absolutely stunning vocal line, it’s quite unlike anything else I’ve heard this year, and all the better for it. Pulling in a Brooklyn rap duo, The Lost Souls, for one track, the ambition can only be praised, as she builds an EP quite unlike any other, and it’s these unique ideas that have to be celebrated.\n\nAs a whole, it sort of sounds like a very experimental Lapsley remix; unrelenting and outlandish. As part of a collective called [Block The Wind](http://www.blockthewind.com/), a quick visit to their website suggests a youthful, free spirited ideology, with members seemingly from all over the world, there’s poetry, photographs and art, all combining to form something rather beautiful. Check out a couple of EP highlights below, and grab the full release [here](https://libbyj.bandcamp.com/releases).\n\nFollow our [Spotify On Repeat playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a hand-picked selection of the current hottest tracks.",
