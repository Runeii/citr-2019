  "body": "Loyle Carner’s ‘A Little Late’ EP is one of the strongest UK rap releases of recent times, and while this may sound dangerously like hyperbole, we’re not the only ones who are lashing such praise on this young Londoner.\n\nApparently a year in the making, the EP was delayed at the start of this year by the sad passing of Carner’s father, thus it’s weighty and apt title ‘A Little Late’. There is no doubt the tragic loss of his father had a massive influence on Carner’s debut effort, with the fragile and highly emotional ‘BFG’ opening the EP  with a resilient, raw honesty. The remainder of the EP demonstrates a variety of influences and styles, employing sounds of jazz, blues, and soul, all of which is underpinned by Carner’s smooth and intelligent lyrical flow.\n\nThis is one of our favourite EP releases of 2014, and we can’t wait to hear more.",
