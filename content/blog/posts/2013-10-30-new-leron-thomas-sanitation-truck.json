  "body": "This is the weirdest, yet oddly fucking touching track I’ve been sent in a long time.\n\nIt’s the first piece of work I’ve come across by **Leron Thomas**, but a quick scan of his [Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/leronthomas) suggests he’s been working busily away in spite of me. I’m yet to make my way through his entire output, but his new cut Sanitation Truck seems like as good a place as any to start. It combines the bathetic narratives of early **Busdriver** material with the sincerity of **Twin Shadow**, (almost), to pretty engrossing effect. There’s a real charm to an adult retelling a story from childhood with the same wide-eyed confusion of the time, with just the right amount of perspective to give the whole thing weight.\n\nTentatively excited for more.",
