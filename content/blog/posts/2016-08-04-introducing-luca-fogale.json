  "body": "This beautiful debut full length release from British Columbia’s **Luca Fogale** is really striking a chord with me right now.\n\nSound wise it reminds me of the second Ben Howard album, which I was utterly obsessed with, mixed with a slightly more polished version of Bon Iver’s For Emma, Forever Ago, maybe even a little bit of A A Bondy thrown in for good measure. Poignant and searingly honest, it’s emotive folk at it’s most endearing and heart wrenching. Check out a couple of highlights below, however if you have any sense, you’ll give the [full record a listen](https://open.spotify.com/album/6tgbjRYSkt8AHTBwG4lP3u).\n\n_nothing makes these long nights end_\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.\n\n<a href=\"http://lucafogale.bandcamp.com/album/safety\">Safety by Luca Fogale</a>",
