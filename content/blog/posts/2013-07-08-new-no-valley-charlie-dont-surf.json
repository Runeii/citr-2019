NY’s Wayne Memmer aka **No Valley** joined by Jason Sarubbi and  \nNikolai Middlebrook may well have written one of the most ‘fun’ tracks of the year. _Charlie Don’t Surf_ is raucous, light-hearted rock and roll at it’s best, avoiding the turgid stonk of The Vaccines and drawing ever so slightly from the 80’s influences that The Drums attempt to copy. Check out _Charlie Don’t Surf_ below.\n\n_he’s good at messing with your mind / and he likes to play with knives_",
