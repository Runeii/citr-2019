  "body": "You know it’s been a good few days for music when you haven’t had time to write about a new **CoolRunnings** single, but alas, it’s the week I’ve had.\n\nThe single itself, **_Fool Moon/Rusk_**, shows a remarkable growth in the fidelity of sound. The a-side, **_Full Moon_**, smothers the listener in an expansive synth loop, with the mellow vocal and guitar work giving the track a sense of intimacy, it almost sounds like someone serenading an apocalyptic event. The b-side goes in a different direction entirely, but still sports the exploitation opposing sounds. It diverges from sparsely arranged verses to gritty reverb laden choruses; it feels like a battle in ideology, with the sounds at war, not to find a truce, but to destroy the other.\n\nStream the single below, and by the 7” [here.](http://www.roughtrade.com/site/shop_detail.lasso?search_type=sku&sku=342142)\n\n [COOLRUNNINGS – Too Pure Singles Club 7″](http://soundcloud.com/draculahorse/sets/coolrunnings-too-pure-singles) by [DRACULA HORSE](http://soundcloud.com/draculahorse)",
