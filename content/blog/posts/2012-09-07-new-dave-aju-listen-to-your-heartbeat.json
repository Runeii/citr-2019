  "body": "NB: Not actual artwork.\n\nTalking of funky music (oh, we weren’t? Well we are now), San Francisco producer **Dave Aju’s** new EP entitled **_Listen To Your Heartbeat_** will make you prance your little socks off. Take the title track, a six minute psychedelic seizure, that’s as unique as it is totally enthralling. Choppy percussion sections and breathy vocals contrast splendidly, forming a trippy hip-hop influenced sound, with a chorus that grows catchier with every listen. With his new EP out in ten days on [Accidental Records](accidentalrecords.com), this is a release you’re going to want to wrap your ears around.",
