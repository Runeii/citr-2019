  "date": "2016-08-01T16:10:43",
  "body": "Despite only having been posted on one Hype Machine listed blog thus far, _Where’s My Love_, the debut offering from **SYML** (Seattle’s Brian Fennell) has managed to clock up an impressive one million Spotify streams already.\n\n Influence wise we’re talking the likes of Perfume Genius, How To Dress Well and Keaton Henson in the sparse production and intimate, emotional songwriting, all underpinned by Fennell’s delicate yet controlling vocal. Powerful stuff. Check out Where’s My Love below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
