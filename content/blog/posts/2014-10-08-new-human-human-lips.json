  "body": "Having first met during their high school years, Montreal quartet **Human Human** have taken their time over the past couple of years, perfecting and honing their song writing skills.\n\n_Debut_ offering, _Lips_, is a slickly produced, anthemic number; all pulsating synths and a Brandon Flowers-esque lead vocal, culminating in a massive singalong, it’s one of this years most impressive new tracks. More than anything, it reminds me of The Cure, and that’s ALWAYS a good thing.",
