  "body": "_“Going nowhere fast, take it all in slow”_\n\nLet me get this straight, I don’t know much about hip-hop and I’m not going to pretend that I do. To be honest, I don’t really know if this is hip-hop. What I do know is that _Chi Glow_, the latest cut from Sydney duo **Fishing** is one a hell of a listen. Wrapped in a dream-like electro glaze, the track allows you to drift off, succumbing to the chiming steel drum synths and contorted vocals. This is what **Washed Out** would sound like if Ernest Greene was a rapper.\n\nCheck out the video fro _Chi Glow_ above which features on **Fishing’s** new album _Shy Glow_, out June 6th.",
