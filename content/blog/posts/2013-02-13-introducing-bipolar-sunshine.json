  "body": "A little while ago now we were graced with an email from the intriguingly named **Bipolar Sunshine**.\n\nThe email was sweet, humble and most importantly the track that accompanied it was thoroughly remarkable. It took us all aback, but for some reason, in the midst of life running away from us, we forgot to write about him.\n\nDespite such a frank email, we still know very little about the Manchester based artist, however the words he used to describe his debut track goes to some lengths to explain his disposition.\n\n### “’Fire’ is about being around someone you love but at the same time wanting to jump off a cliff, the tipping point in any relationship.”\n\nWith a 3 track EP due out around May, it won’t be too long until you hear more from this exciting talent.",
