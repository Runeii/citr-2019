  "body": "A year on from the release of his previous single, [This Human Joy](https://soundcloud.</p><p>com/ajimal/this-human-joy-1), and **Ajimal** aka Fran O’Hanlon returns with an exquisite new offering in the form of _Nothing Touches Me_. Featured on a split 12″ single alongside a new track from another CitR favourite, Tessera Skies, O’Hanlon’s contribution is a gorgeously blossoming number, weaving his intimate lyricism between rousing, euphoric instrumentation. There are few artists around at this moment in time capable of conjuring up such a magical and moving atmosphere throughout an entire song.\n\nNot only marking the radiant reappearance of Ajimal, it also marks another stepping stone for [Mono](http://www.monoproduction.co.uk/), the North East collective of artists led by Mick Ross, Jonathan Hamilton and James Hennin, through who the double A side vinyl will be released. Check out Nothing Touches Me below, out 1 December 2014.\n\nAjimal Tour Dates:\n\nThurs 16th October: King Tut’s Wah Wah Hut, Glasgow w/ Woman’s Hour\n\nTues 21st October: The Islington, London (Free Communion/Transmission headline show)\n\nSat 22nd November: High & Lonesome Festival, Leeds\n\nSun 7th December: The Sage, Gateshead w/ Jo Hamilton",
