  "body": "[**Danny Brown**’s](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Danny-Brown/170353993015979) music should come with a disclaimer; ‘likely to induce a temporary state of madness and/or schizophrenia’, would be a good start. His follow up to the utterly fucking crazy ‘[Hybrid](http://rappersiknow.bandcamp.com/album/the-hybrid-2)’ continues in the same eccentric, blissfully offensive vein.\n\nDespite **Brown**’s awkward and borderline silly voice, he actually has a lot to say. The track, ‘Radio Song’, is quick witted and thumping comment on the state of hip-hop and black culture. For every line that invokes poignancy however, **Brown** turns the tables entirely, suggesting we “make **Sarah Palin** deep throat till she hiccups” is a particularly inedible highlight.\n\nIt’s this effortless ability to manipulate tone that makes **_XXX_** so inviting, it thrusts **Brown**‘s personality in a listeners’ face with such venom it’s impossible not to be won over, or at the very least have an opinion.\n\nStream the new LP below.\n\n [Danny Brown “XXX”](http://soundcloud.com/foolsgoldrecs/sets/danny-brown-xxx) by [foolsgoldrecs](http://soundcloud.com/foolsgoldrecs)",
