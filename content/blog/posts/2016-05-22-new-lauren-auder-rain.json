Its tensions are shallowed, surfacing sombreness discerned, but it’s not coated in misery: it’s more affecting than affronting. There is elevation, elevation in realisation or elevation in fragmentation (a lift either way), allowing moments of gravity to righteously fall: as they should. It shakes awareness into you, your conscious state and your listening when edging to a closing it dwells upon, disturbing a set moment with its present utterings.\n\nAlso: heroic looking artwork: fun.",
