Since the start of the year, he’s been touring Europe, the US, and Australia, stopping off at Sasquatch Festival in the States and opening up the Other Stage at Glastonbury this Sunday – and in the middle of all this, we were lucky enough to catch him before his (spectacular) show in Sunderland for a quick acoustic session. If anyone’s heading off to Glasto this weekend, these videos should be proof enough that you need to see this guy.\n\n(Ta muchly to Dan and his management, especially for persevering through light drizzle, broken guitar strings and a city inexplicably caught up in Kings of Leon fever to give us this session)",
