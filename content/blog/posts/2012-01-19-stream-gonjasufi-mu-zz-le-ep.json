  "date": "2012-01-19T22:32:39",
  "body": "With this, his fourth album, **Gonjasufi** aka **Sumach Valentine/Ecks** yet again reinvents his sound, carving an entirely fresh notch to those previously experienced from the San Diego musician.\n\nThere’s the gritty _Nikels and Dimes_ that is as abrasive as it is beautfiul, coupled alongside the reverb-laden _Feedin Birds_, also featuring a cameo from his wife. It’s a challenging, disjointed listen at times, but ultimately rewarding, as **Gonjasufi** treads the line between raw lo-fi and hip hop.\n\nStream _MU.ZZ.LE EP_ below, out 24 January via [Warp](http://warp.net/records/gonjasufi). \n\nVia [The Fader](http://www.thefader.com/2012/01/19/stream-gonjasufis-album-mu-zz-le/)",
