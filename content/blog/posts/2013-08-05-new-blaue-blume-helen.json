Part Alt-J, part Wild Beasts, it’s further proof that the Copenhagen band are one of the most exciting prospects around at this present moment. Check out _Helen_ below, and be sure to catch them at one of their debut UK shows (dates after the jump).\n\ndon’t you remember me / met when we were 17 / wrote each others names in a heart on a tree\n\n[20 August, Birthdays, London](https://www.facebook.com/events/194308167398634/)\n\n[21 August, Dulcimer Bar, Manchester](https://www.facebook.com/events/153038591553249/)",
