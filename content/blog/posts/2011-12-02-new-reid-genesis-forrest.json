  "body": "When I visited Ireland in September for **Hard Working Class Heroes** Music Festival, I was struck by just how vibrant the electronic scene was.\n\nWith CitR favourites **Solar Bears** making a name for themselves throughout Europe, and beat maestro **Toby Kaar** destined to go that way, Cork’s **REID** may well be the next to follow suit. These two new tracks from the young producer show just how diverse his sound can be, whilst remaining grounded amongst atmospheric surroundings.\n\nA Side _Genesis_ is a gloriously soulful number, gradually building layers throughout it’s five minute run time, morphing beautifully to showcase the various elements **REID** has at his disposal. There’s touches of **Four Tet** mixed in with instrumental moments of **Blackbird Blackbird**, with B-side _Forrest_ being more of a grower, adopting a playful approach to creation. Minimal dubstep elements combine with a solid, repetitive hook to lull the listener into a bliss inducing trance, simply wonderful. Check out both tracks below, out now on **[Blah Blah Blah Records](http://www.weareblahblahblah.com/)**.\n\n [Genesis](http://soundcloud.com/reid/sets/genesis-bbb001) by [REID](http://soundcloud.com/reid)",
