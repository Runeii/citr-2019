It was his [collaborative effort](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/18155-new-hot-sugar-haleek-maul-i-dont-wanna-b-judged/ \"New: Hot Sugar & Haleek Maul – I Don’t Wanna B Judged\") with NYC via Barbados MC **Haleek Maul** however, that finally brought his music to a wider audience. Sure, his cuts still remain very much within the blog world, but regardless, more people are listening. In terms of collaboration his new Ep, _MiDi Murder EP_, is his most ambitious. Featuring **Haleek Maul, Antwon, Fat Tony, Big Baby Ghandi, Heems, KOOL AD** and **Shady Blaze**, it’s a clusterfuck of wackball MCs and the result is pretty damn exciting.\n\nStream and D/L the EP below.",
