  "body": "**Escapists** are a London based four piece who create massively emphatic guitar driven pop and we are delighted to premiere their new track _Ocean Of Noise_ which is taken from their debut album _Only Bodies_, out August 4th.\n\nWhen I first clicked play, images of the summer months speeding past me, disappearing into the muted colours of autumn shot straight into my head. Maybe it’s the short lived, sporadic summer I’m experiencing up here in Glasgow, or maybe it’s the drifting haze of the guitars and the propelling rhythm destined for the sunset slot at every festival across the country. Describing the track as “dark disco”, Escapists aren’t afraid of their pop aesthetic and judging by this release, coupled with their previous efforts, the mainstream and the indie kids won’t be either.\n\nStream _Ocean Of Noise_ below as well as previous tracks Eyes, Breaking It Up and Blood, all of which will be featured on their debut album _Only Bodies_:",
