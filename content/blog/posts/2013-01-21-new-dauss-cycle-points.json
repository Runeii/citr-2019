  "body": "Although not a household name in electronic music, **Dauss’s** new gem _Cycle Points_ put him up there with the best.\n\nA real ‘head-bobber’ if I ever heard one, the atmosphere is intense yet brooding, far more intelligent and much less abrasive than the vast majority of up-and-coming producers dominating the current scene. Drawing from the likes of **Pantha Du Prince** and **Bonobo**, **Dauss** may still be finding his feet, but _Cycle Points_ is certainly worth clinging onto for the moment.",
