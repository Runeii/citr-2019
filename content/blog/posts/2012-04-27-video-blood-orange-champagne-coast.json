The album undoubtedly had some great tracks; it just didn’t completely sell me on its substance.\n\nThe new video directed by **Haley Wollens**, for the track _Champagne Coast,_ goes to some lengths to rectify the matter. Using jerky, awkward and at times down right creepy animations, the work is an interestingly surreal and digitally demonic alternate reality.\n\nIt also features **Karley Sciortino**, awwww yeah.",
