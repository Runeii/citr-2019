  "body": "Hotel is a collective of recent graduates that promote other young and up and coming artists- based across Manchester, Liverpool and London.\n\nTheir shows to date include _[Bridges Help People Cross Rivers](http://cargocollective.com/Hotel/Bridges-Help-People-Cross-Rivers), [AARD](http://cargocollective.com/Hotel/AARD)_ and [_30 Kilos of Cocaine Used to Draw the Lines of a Football Field_](http://cargocollective.com/Hotel/30-Kilos-of-Cocaine-Used-to-Draw-the-Lines-of-a-Football-Field) and they were impressively listed on the Hot 100 Artist-Led spaces in the piece of work by [Kevin Hun](http://www.kevin-hunt.co.uk/userimages/hot%20100.jpg)t.\n\nWith refreshingly little in the way of blurb (press releases, themes etc.) the thing that seems to hold all the shows together is a sense of manipulation of material, references and information, with an interesting relationship to the various spaces. What the fuck does that even mean, I don’t know, I’ve got chronic dissertation headache and keep churning out bullshit statements like that. Really- there’s a wedge of Vienetta (?) being used as a doorstop, a large metal frame with those fluffy multi-coloured pound shop feather duster things attached to them that make it look like a kind of car wash, I’ve spotted a Kappa mug and a Dunkin’ Donuts sculpture- all orchestrated in relationship to simply stacked and ordered cups, balanced, bare wood and glass pieces that soften the noise of the pop buzz. What I mean is- there is a cohesive sense, of a deliberate kind of aesthetic that binds the shows together: one of simple decisions, clever jokes and suggestions that are well executed and well curated. There’s a sense of making it all look quite easy; to be young and clever and making cool shit, and to be putting on shows with your mates. The whole thing seems sincere, and works really well. I look forward to what they do next.\n\n#gallery-1 { margin: auto; } #gallery-1 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } #gallery-1 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-1 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } /\\* see gallery\\_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php \\*/\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/HOTEL-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/25277-profile-hotel-collective/attachment/hotel)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hotel-1-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/25277-profile-hotel-collective/attachment/hotel-1)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hotel-3-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/25277-profile-hotel-collective/attachment/hotel-3)\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/30-kilos--150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/25277-profile-hotel-collective/attachment/30-kilos)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/AARD-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/25277-profile-hotel-collective/attachment/aard)\n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hotel-4-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/25277-profile-hotel-collective/attachment/hotel-4)\n\n  \n\n[![](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hotel-2-150x150.jpg)](https://admin.crackintheroad.com/arts/25277-profile-hotel-collective/attachment/hotel-2)\n\n  \n\nFollow them on [facebook.com/Hotelcollective](https://www.facebook.com/Hotelcollective)\n\nAnd see all the exhibited artist’s names on [cargocollective.com/Hotel](http://cargocollective.com/Hotel)",
