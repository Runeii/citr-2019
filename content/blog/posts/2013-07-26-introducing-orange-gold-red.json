  "body": "The new project of **Andrew Gregory**, of NY group **Tubetops**, **Orange Gold Red** sees the producer team up with fellow Brooklynite, vocalist [Kate Copland](https://soundcloud.com/katecopeland). With the pop sensibilities of the likes of **Robyn** or **Ellie Goulding**, and the quirky production more in line with **Grimes** or **Purity Ring**, their two debut tracks are rather gorgeous. There’s the brash, out-and-out pop of _Figure Eights,_ and the more refined, reserved, but no less beautiful wistful nature of _Ink_, where Gregory takes up backing vocals. Whilst it’s clear that **Orange Red Gold** is still very much in its infancy, these two tracks are an extremely promising sign of what’s to come.",
