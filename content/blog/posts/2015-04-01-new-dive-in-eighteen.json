  "title": "New: Dive In – Eighteen",
  "date": "2015-04-01T14:18:57",
  "body": "**Dive In** first reared their heads about eighteen months back, with their debut single, _Let Go_.\n\nHaving spent the past year or so writing, recording and rehearsing for live shows, the Glastonbury based trio are gearing up to unleash their debut EP, out at the end of May through Vagrant. Eighteen is about as ambitious a return as you’ll hear this year – booming synth sections and a Lightning Seeds-esque chorus mark the track out as a future festival favourite. This deserves repeat listens.\n\nCheck out Eighteen below, and catch their live return at The Lexington for The Line of Best Fit on 5 August ([Tickets](https://billetto.co.uk/dive-in?utm_source=TLOBF&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=AFF)).",
