  "body": "Are **Odd Future** still relevant? So 2011 didn’t quite go as they’d hoped, with several critics slamming **Tyler, the Creator’s** major label debut _**GOBLIN**_, and a host of controversial festival appearances doing more to damage their reputation than enhance it.\n\nAnyway, it appears they’re beginning to mature ever-so slightly, with new release _**OF Tape Vol. 2**_ just around the corner, and a bunch of tour dates announced for later in the year.\n\nIn anticipation of said release, they’ve ‘leaked’ the closing track _Oldie_ onto the net, with it rapidly spreading across the blogosphere, largely due to it’s inclusion of everyones’s favourite **OF** member **Earl Sweatshirt**. Standing at ten minutes long, it’s not until the second to last verse that **Earl** gets the mic, and he doesn’t disappoint.",
