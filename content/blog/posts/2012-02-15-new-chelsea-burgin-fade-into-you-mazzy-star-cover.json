  "body": "So yesterday sucked, right?  Not only did I not receive a single Valentines (thanks guys), but I also discovered my #2 heartthrob **Lana Del Rey** is dating a hillbilly from a distinctly average Scottish group.\n\nDevastated just doesn’t cut it. Luckily for my broken heart, my #1 crush, a certain Miss **Chelsea Burgin** graced our ears with a sublime cover of **Mazzy Star’s** haunting _Fade Into You_. Entirely acoustic, Chelsea’s spotless vocals fit the track perfectly, making for a truly stunning listen.\n\nCheck out _Fade Into You_ below and grab a free download.",
