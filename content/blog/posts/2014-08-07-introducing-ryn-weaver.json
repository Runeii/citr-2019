  "body": "With her debut single, _OctaHate_, clocking up a mightily impressive 1 million + plays in little over a month, it’s safe to say that **Ryn Weaver** is already destined for stardom.\n\nPunchy, expertly produced and cooler than cooler, she’s already an essential modern day popstar. With her debut EP out later this year, she’s released a second track, _Promises_, another instantly appealing hit in waiting. Check out both below, and keep up with her on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/RynWeaver).",
