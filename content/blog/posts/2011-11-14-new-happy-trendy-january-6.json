  "body": "Ahead of his upcoming EU tour with **Foxes In Fiction**, synth-pop maestro **HAPPY TRENDY** has dropped a new cut (premiered via our friends at [BIRP](http://www.birp.fm/blog/5594-premiere-happy-trendy-january-6)) set to feature on next’s week _**Die Young EP**_. _January 6_ is a glitchy lo-fi tune, seeing **Dylan Khotin-Foote** and **Rachel Levy** doubling up on vocal duties. Sonically, it brings about memories of **Casiotone For The Painfully Alone**, albeit bringing the sound into a more modern perspective. “_Barely slept last night, half awake, eyes half closed, as the sun hits your face_” being one particular moment that’s as heartbreaking as it is uplifting.
