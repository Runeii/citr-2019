  "date": "2013-04-14T00:28:19",
  "body": "Having made a name for themselves with their wonderfully bizarre [debut video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_si1qhMBN4), soundtracked by their cover of _Islands In The Stream_ penned by the Bee Gees, Manchester trio** Ménage à Trois** are back with the b-side, in the form of the gloriously 70’s-esque _Monument_. Not only is it arguably a better track than the cover on the A-side, but it also proves that Ménage à Trois are talented in their own right. Soulful, moving and devastatingly beautiful, they’re rapidly proving themselves to be one of the UK’s finest new acts. With little information as to their identities, aside from the connection with **WU LYF’**s Joseph Manning (also of [Los Porcos](www.crackintheroad.com/music/20595-new-los-porcos-do-you-wanna-live-jesus-luvs-u-baby/)), you can guarantee that their debut cassette will sell out in no time. Pick it up [here](http://menage-a-trois.bandcamp.com/), and check out the video for _Monument_ below, as well a Soundcloud stream of Islands In The Stream below that.",
