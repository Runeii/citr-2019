Call to Prayer, the new track from The Border Surrender makes you want to do entirely that, just go wild and get lost amongst the viciously deep synths and singalong choruses. Starting off upon sombre and downbeat, with just a few chords on a keyboard and enticing combined vocals. However it quickly picks up, launching into the tracks addictive chorus, “you better go way down in that hole if you don’t hear the call to prayer”, walls the lead singer of The Border Surrender, almost drowned out by rasping synths and the shimmering guitars. Check it out below.\n\n [The Border Surrender – Call To Prayer](http://soundcloud.com/benny-2/the-border-surrender-call-to) by [Smoky Carrot Records](http://soundcloud.com/benny-2)",
