As enticing and tantalizingly sensual as ever, it’s the perfect combination of a stunning image and equally as appealing music.\n\n[Stabb Session #1 “Sweetest Kill” -Broken Social Scene, Cover- by, Jackie Stabb.](http://vimeo.com/52569325) from [Jackie Stabb](http://vimeo.com/jackiestabb) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
