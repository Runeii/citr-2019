  "body": "Dundee outfit **ST.**\n\n**MARTiiNS** have been around for a few years in various guises, having been in a band together since their early teens, and featuring on these pages before, but now it appears that they’ve reached their most coherent, fully realised sound so far. Their debut outing, _Bad Art_, seemingly draws from the likes of The 1975 and Two Door Cinema Club, in the frenetic guitar riff, and cutting, straight to the point songwriting.
