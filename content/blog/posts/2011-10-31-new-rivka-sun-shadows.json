  "body": "As if you need reminding about Halloween.\n\nCall me a muggle, but it’s worse than Christmas for needless celebrating. From having snotty nosed kids in soiled bedsheets knocking on your door, to teenage girls donning miniscule shorts, bunny ears (rabbits are NOT scary) and acting even more frivolous, I’m yet to see the excitement behind ‘modern’ Halloween. However, one positive aspect to have come from the deplorable occasion, is the way in which musicians adopt a more traditional approach, choosing to air their darker sides through their favoured creative medium.\n\nThis new track from Miami duo **RIVKA** is a gloriously, dare I say, haunting affair. Sounding like a walk through a deserted neighbourhood in the early hours of the morning, _Sun Shadows_ is atmospheric, brooding and most importantly, so much more than just a cliched Halloween track. So, leave your miniskirt behind tonight, refrain from playing _Thriller_, do something a little different and let _Sun Shadows_ be your soundtrack.",
