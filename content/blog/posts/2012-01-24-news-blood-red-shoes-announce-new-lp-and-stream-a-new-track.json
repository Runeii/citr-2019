Cold is a heavily percussion led affair, with a brooding guitar riff laboring throughout the track, as **Ansell** and **Carter** continuously swap vocal duties. They’ve also announced details of a full UK tour, which you can see the dates for below. Check out _Cold_ below and pre-order _**In Time To Voices**_ via the **Blood Red Shoes** [website](http://www.bloodredshoes.co.uk/home/).\n\n[![](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/332773_10150471888331307_9059291306_8924306_15314969_o-640x536.jpg \"Blood Red Shoes Tour\")](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14393-news-blood-red-shoes-announce-new-lp-and-stream-a-new-track/attachment/332773_10150471888331307_9059291306_8924306_15314969_o/)",
