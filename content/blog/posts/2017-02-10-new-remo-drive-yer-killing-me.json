  "title": "NEW: REMO DRIVE – YER KILLING ME",
  "date": "2017-02-10T17:06:03",
  "body": "In a time where many have already put the final nail in the coffin of indie/punk/rock/emo (circle where relevant) young Minnesotans, Remo Drive, have released a single that delays the funeral.\n\nWith a combination of infectious melodies, tight performances and reflective hollered vocals _Yer Killing Me_ is one of the best pop punk anthems you will have heard in recent times. Everything about the song is fun and accessible but keeps enough style and edge to make it stand out. The band have also somehow managed to avoid the over-nostalgic trap, while clearly not hiding their sonic influences of the late 00’s.  Keep an ear out for their debut album “Greatest Hits” dropping March 16th.",
