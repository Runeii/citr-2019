  "body": "Brooklyn’s **Elysse** shines on her silky smooth debut single, _Eve_ – merging her downright luxurious vocal with some exquisitely plush production.\n\nSongwriting wise, there’s almost a 60’s crooner edge to it – in truth, if you stripped away the production, I could imagine this being played on a grand piano in an uber-trendy NY dive bar (if those still exist?!). Check it out below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
