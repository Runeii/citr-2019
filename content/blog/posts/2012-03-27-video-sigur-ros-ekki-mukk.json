  "body": "Having only announced details of _**[Valtari](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/15816-news-sigur-ros-unveil-details-of-new-album-valtari/)**_, their sixth studio album, a couple of days ago **Sigur Rós** are clearly eager to get their new music out there. With over 150,000 views of lead track _Ekki Múkk_ in under 24 hours, it’s obvious that they aren’t the only ones anticipating their return. **Jónsi’s** vocals are as refined and biblically elegant as ever, whilst the instrumentation showcases the ‘drone’ inspirations that the group have talked about recently. The tranquil, minimal visuals come courtesy of **Jónsi’s** sister, _Inga Birgisdóttir_ and are as hypnotizing and gloriously bewitching as the music. Check out _Ekki Múkk_ below.\n\n[Sigur Rós – Ekki múkk](http://vimeo.com/39194761) from [Sigur Rós](http://vimeo.com/sigurros) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
