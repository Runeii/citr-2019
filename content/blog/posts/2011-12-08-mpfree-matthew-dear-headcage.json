  "body": "Mr **Matthew Dear** graces us once again with his brilliance.\n\nThe acclaimed **Ghostly International** label boss hit us with _Black City_ last year, which for me was one of the most perfectly formed pop albums of the last decade. Channelling a lovely meld of Byrne/Bowie/Gabriel (just a few that spring to mind), sprinklings of Prince, and a techno framework (boiled down further with his **Audion** side project), he really has a bigger personality than most musicians and really deserves more credit for his sheer creativity.\n\nHe seems to fill a void that we didn’t know was there. And he does a great job of showing his contemporaries up over recent years. To give you an idea of the kind of diverse electronic styles this man is interested in I’ll give you a snippet of his label roster: **Dabrye**, **Tycho**, **Gold Panda**, and **Com Truise**. And If you’re embarrassed to not have engorged yourself on _Black City_, I’d try and keep an eye out for his upcoming release, _Beams_. This track is just a tease of what’s to come – it’s the title track of a new EP out in January – but after that what we can probably expect is a hugely ambitious pop album, considering his track record. Enjoy.\n\n_Listen to and download Headcage below._",
