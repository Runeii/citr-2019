  "body": "With what will most likely be his final output of 2011, **Star Slinger** has tried his hand at remixing _Before I Move Off_ by London duo **Mount Kimbie**.\n\nWhere the original finds beauty through it’s minimal, atmospheric feel, **Star Slinger** reinvents the track as a more club friendly dance number.

Stream and download _Before I Move Off (Star Slinger Refix)_ below.\n\n [Mount Kimbie – Before I Move Off \\[Star Slinger Refix\\]](http://soundcloud.com/starslingeruk/mount-kimbie-star-slinger-before-i-move-off) by [Star Slinger](http://soundcloud.com/starslingeruk)",
