  "body": "Having only dropped his [debut EP](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/17854-review-mood-indigo-people-ep/) a matter of days ago, Boston’s **Mood Indigo** is already back with new music, in the form of the fantastic _Midnight Children_.

Check it out below, and grab a free download if it’s your sort of thing.",
