  "body": "It took me a few listens to really appreciate the beauty in this EP from Cambridge five piece **Holden Girls**.\n\nHaving heard the lead single, _A Western_, a month or so back, it slipped my mind to write about it, and in truth, it didn’t grab me on first listen, however visiting it for a second time amidst the context of their debut EP, I truly sunk in. Their melancholic, shoegaze influenced sound touches upon moments of _Spanish Sahara_\\-era Foals, yet without the pop undercurrents. Tales of loss, despair and desperation litter the release, _‘in the sea where the water is cool and bright / you didn’t see / how could you’_, almost feeling like it should be soundtracking Nevil Schute’s post-apocalyptic classic [On The Beach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Beach_(novel)). Don’t expect Holden Girls to have you dancing, or even smiling, but there’s an understated elegance to each and every track of theirs, that once you discover it, will have you hooked. Check out the full EP below, including my personal favourite, _Sun_.",
