  "body": "You’d think everyone would have heard enough French electronic music to last them a lifetime by now.\n\nThat’s not to belittle the strength of [**Boys In Lilies**](https://www.facebook.com/BoysInLilies) debut EP, _Hatching_, a hugely promising release, that improves in quality as each track goes by. Opening with the melancholic, slightly underwhelming twinkle of _Ode To Sailors_, by the time the group from Tours flow effortlessly into _Runaway_, you’ll be well and truly in love. With the playful vocals of lead singer Laure Berneau intertwining gorgeously with the glittering synth and guitar sections, **Boys In Lilies** carve out a sound that is immediately accesible, yet entirely their own. Check out EP highlight _The Bird_ below, and the full EP under that. Well and truly one of the most beautiful new artists of 2013.",
