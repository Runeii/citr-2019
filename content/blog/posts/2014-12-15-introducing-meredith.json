  "body": "Australia coming out on top for the umpteenth time this year.\n\nOn her most recent offering, _Jumpin Beds_, **Meredith** (Barker) effortlessly merges the majesty and wistful lyricism of Lorde, with the more lo-fi, downbeat production generally associated with Casiotone for the Painfully Alone. The accompanying video is a late-night stroll through downtown Brisbane, taking in the those all too relatable moments of solitude. Check out Jumpin’ Beds below, alongside an older track, Darkness.\n\n[MEREDITH – JUMPIN BEDS](http://vimeo.com/110985454) from [Danny McShane](http://vimeo.com/dannymcshanefilms) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com).",
