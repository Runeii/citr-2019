  "body": "**GEMS** are rapidly becoming a household name, and honestly, it couldn’t happen to a more deserving band.\n\nHaving just announced themselves for SXSW 2014, as well as a handful of shows in the run up toy March, the DC duo have also released this mailing list exclusive cover of Seal’s 1995 classic, _Don’t Cry_. As with their debut EP, Medusa, and with all of their output, be it visual or sonic, it’s orchestrated with the utmost class, dignity and beauty. This is why GEMS are my new favourite band. Subscribe to their mailing list [here](http://gems-band.us5.list-manage2.com/subscribe?u=ecfd0b66f94a487b239a4429c&id=b1447a3081), and check out Don’t Cry below.",
