  "date": "2012-03-20T00:03:16",
  "body": "These two new pieces from Nottingham’s **Comodo** are perfect for the tranquil nights we’re blessed with at the moment; watching the last light dwindling on the horizon whilst _Havana_ floats elegantly in the background is quite an experience.\n\nSparse, ambient beats and gliding samples steer the track, seductively lulling the listener into a nigh-on meditative state. On the flip side, _Float_ is an almost dubstep inspired affair, again using a similar technique with the looped vocals, playing upon the repetitive nature and minimal atmosphere. Check out both cuts below.\n\n<a href=\"http://comodo.bandcamp.com/album/havana-float\">Havana/Float by Comodo</a>",
