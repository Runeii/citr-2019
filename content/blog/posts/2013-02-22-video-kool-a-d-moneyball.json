  "body": "httpv://www.\n\nyoutube.com/watch?v=Qy7j96s8Ciw\n\nI have no idea what’s going on with [Kool A.D](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/artist/kool-a-d/). and [Heems](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/artist/heems/) currently. It seems that as soon as one ex-Das Racist member releases something, the other is hot on his heels. Earlier today, [Heems dropped the video for ‘Shoegaze Desi Taiko’](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/20024-video-heems-desi-shoegaze-taiko/) and then, mere hours later, Kool A.D. releases his own for the track ‘Moneyball’.\n\nThe track, which is off his _63_ mixtape, is one of the highlights of the album and the video differs quite dramatically from Heems’. Rather than being constructed from [the beginning of a film](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_(film)), ‘Moneyball’ finds Kool A.D. in a variety of psychedelic situations in which he is framed as some kind of bohemian overlord. It’s definitely a far artier affair than the Heems’ piece and has considerably more staying power, even if the concept is not quite as amusing.\n\nStill, whatever happens I’m delighted that both ex-members of Das Racist seem to have actually upped their activity levels since the group disbanded. You can find information about Kool A.D.’s two latest mixtapes _19 _and _63_ [here](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/19525-mixtapes-kool-a-d-63-and-19/).",
