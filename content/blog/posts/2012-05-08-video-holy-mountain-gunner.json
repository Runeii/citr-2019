Busting out the blocks with the kind of lower-than-hell riffery you’d expect from a song by a band with the same name as a Sleep record, _Gunner_ alone absolutely fucking destroys anything else I’ve heard in the heavy stakes this year. Shitting your pants never felt so good.\n\nBegin your ascent [here](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Holy-Mountain/328120915411 \"Praise be. \").",
