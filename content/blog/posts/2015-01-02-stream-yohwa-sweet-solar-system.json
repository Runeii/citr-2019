  "body": "Starting 2015 by posting one of the finest releases of last year; **Yo$hwa** [came to my attention](http://admin.</p><p>crackintheroad.com/music/30552-introducing-yohwa) with the release of his track $hwa Forever, leading me to a Soundcloud of other releases, and subsequently this mixtape unleashed at the end of December. **_Sweet Solar System_** is ambitious and explosive, part Chance the Rapper (Sometimezzz), part A$AP Rocky (Kennedy), part Kanye West, melodic and intelligent throughout. What really stands out is an admirable sense of community amongst the artists, be it Kylie Gary’s chorus on Problem Child or Da Grant’s section on mixtape closer Loopzzz. Still only 17 years old, Yo$hwa (and main producer Ckeelay) have marked themselves out as two of 2015’s most exciting prospects. Check out the full release below.",
