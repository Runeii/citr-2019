  "body": "This new track from NY’s **Warm Speakers** is rather fitting for current weather conditions, with the summer well and truly behind us, and shorter days and colder mornings beginning to kick in, _Youth_ acts as a sort of Autumn-comedown.\n\nIf you had to stereotype, it’d probably fall under the glo-fi genre, yet the last minute in particular are far too beautiful to be hurriedly categorized. There’s touches of **Washed Out** and **Blackbird Blackbird** in the instrumental sections, whilst the vocals add a much needed extra layer, preventing it from becoming ‘just another chillwave song’. Check out _Youth_ below, the first track from **Warm Speaker’s** upcoming full length, expected 2012.\n\n<a href=\"http://warmspeakers.bandcamp.com/track/youth\">Youth by Warm Speakers</a>",
