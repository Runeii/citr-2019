  "body": "Ending the year with a bang, **Rochelle Jordan** takes up this **Lil Wayne** beat and destroys it in the best way possible.\n\nWhilst 2012 hasn’t quite been the year that RoJo exploded into the mainstream like I initially predicted, the hype has been slowly but surely building, putting her in a fantastic position heading into ’13. Mixing her soulful vocals and feisty flow with the near perfect production by **KLSH**, _Impossible_ is may well be the last we hear of Jordan in 2012, but you can bet she’ll be back for more over the coming twelve months.",
