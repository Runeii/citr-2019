  "body": "**Shura** already released the best pop song of the year, (see [Touch](https://soundcloud.</p><p>com/shura/shura-touch)), and she’s back again with another stunner. _Just Once_, perhaps the best pre-break-up song of the year, well and truly puts her on the map as one of this years most exciting new stars. At this point it feels like her career could go two ways, either keep writing exquisite, cult-forming (seriously, look at people practically hyperventilating on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=shura&src=typd)) pop songs, or crossover to a far more mainstream perspective. Either way, more songs like this please.",
