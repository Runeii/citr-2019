  "date": "2014-12-10T16:09:36",
  "body": "**Marika Hackman** has contributed this beautiful version of _O’ Come, O’ Come, Emmanuel_ for Daisy Digital’s curated It’s Coming On Christmas compilation, in aid of [Coppafeel](http://coppafeel.</p><p>org/). As with her recently released single, Drown, it’s Hackman’s vocals that steal the show, simultaneously mesmerising and delicately tender. Several other CitR favourites also feature on the compilation, including Billie Marten, The Half Earth, Ajimal and Kate Miller, which can be purchased [here](https://daisydigital.bandcamp.com/). Check out O’ Come, O’ Come, Emmanuel below, alongside a performance of album track, _Claude’s Girl_, for [DIY Mag](http://diymag.com/2014/12/10/marika-hackman-claudes-girl).",
