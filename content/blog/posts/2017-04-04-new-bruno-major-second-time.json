  "body": "Bruno Major’s new track _Second Time _is a gorgeous ballad that needs to be heard.\n\n Originally written by fellow songwriter Jonny Latimer, Bruno released it after getting Jonny’s blessing and has done it all the justice it deserves. A beautiful and simple story of infatuation, the lyrics set the scene supported by a sweet melody. The song feels almost like a lullaby with Bruno’s gentle vocals and fingered picked acoustic, however the addition of tight drums and a woozy guitar solo towards the end of the track keep it from being too sleepy. Check out Second Time in the link below.",
