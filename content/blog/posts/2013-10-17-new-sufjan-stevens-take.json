  "body": "To this day, I stand by my claim that Age of Adz was one of the finest albums of 2010.\n\nWhilst the unrelentingly dense, hyperactive electronic compositions and achingly personal lyrics – not to mention 27 minute closer _Impossible Soul _– put many off, in the context of the record it all made sense. It reflected the mild insanity that its creator had developed during a long term illness, the subsequent need to get out all the ideas he’d pent-up and the schizophrenic imagery of inspiration Royal Robertson.\n\nEarlier, he dropped new track _Take Me _in appropriately understated fashion. Described as a ‘repetitive lo-fi pop demo’ he found under his desk, it fits with the more understated approach the track takes. The twitchy electronics and burst of static filled percussion from _Age of Adz _are present, but are far less overwhelming, sitting alongside ambient keys and twinkling piano. The personal lyrics remain, however they are closer to the despondent ‘letter-to-the-listener’ whispers and yelps of ‘Futile Devices’ and the closing movement of ‘Impossible Soul’, than the angry shouts that made up most of _Age of Adz._\n\nWhether this is a sign that a new album is to follow is anyone’s guess. The throwaway nature of its release would suggest not, however the flurry of activity that heralded _Age of Adz _was largely unforeseeable.\n\nEven if not, it’s great to hear an insight in to how his sound continues to evolve.\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/115523099″ width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]\n\n(Fuck off, I’m not mentioning his letter)",
