  "body": "Birmingham rather inadvertently marked itself on the map in 2012, with the near simultaneous rise of new band trio, Peace, Swim Deep, and Jaws grabbing many of the new music headlines.\n\nHowever as we now head into 2013, Victories at Sea provide a sign that perhaps there is a new wave of music to come out of B-town, though for the time being I’m more than happy to enjoy ‘Stay Positive’ in all its euphoric glamour. Having created a track with boundless energy, a relentless beat, and plentiful transcending synths, Victories at Sea are certainly a band to watch out for this year.",
