  "body": "**[Lovelier Other](http://lovelier-other.com/)** arrive on the scene as an almost complete package; from their dreamy debut track _Leave This Behind_ to their carefully vague press shots, it’s clear that they have past experience in the ‘music industry’. Seeing past what appears to be obvious intentions of gaining success is not always easy, however, thankfully _Leave This Behind_ does more than enough to cast aside any doubts as any predetermined ideas **Lovelier Other** may possess. Silky smooth vocals and a **Beach House** aroma waft past in an elegant manner, yet with no attempts to disguise that the song is anything other than pop music, but it’s bloody brilliant pop music.",
