  "date": "2012-03-25T21:26:05",
  "body": "I’m still to be convinced by **Azealia Banks**.\n\nSure, I find her music rather interesting, but not to the point of me actually wanting to relisten; it’s just an experience that gets tiresome rather quickly. New track, _Fuck Up The Fun_ produced by none other than **Diplo** is supposedly a diss towards **Iggy** and **T.I.** yet as far as put downs go, it’s fairly weak. There’s plenty of **Azealia’s** stereotypical highly offensive spouting, however, to be honest, it’s getting monotonous; come on **Azealia**, we know you’re better than this. At least it has a good beat, right?",
