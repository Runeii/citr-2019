It’s been starring at me, judging me; basically it fucking sucks. What doesn’t suck however is the record; 4 tracks of catchy as hell Beach Boys-infected psychedelic pop, that focus on great pop-song writing rather than sound-exploration, yet manage to succeed in both departments.\n\nIn short, the record had ADHD, vocalists change without warning, glockenspiels fuck synths sonically and all with a haze like fuzz acting as some sort of a comfort blanket to the madness.\n\nYeah, I kind of liked it.",
