  "body": "Russian based producer **Miyuki** spread across the blogs like wildfire several months back with her stunning, minimalist dubstep jams, channeling **Burial** in a futuristic and grossly appealing manner.\n\nHaving released a concept EP in the meantime, detailing the journey of an android living in a post-apocalyptic whirlwind, caught in an eternity of nothingness. Newest cut from the young musician, _Shizukana_, sees her returning more to her roots, and experimenting with the silences and crescendo’s that make her music so immersive. Check it out below.",
