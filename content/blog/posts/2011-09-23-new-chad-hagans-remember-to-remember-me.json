  "body": "[**Chad Hagans**‘](http://chadhagans.bandcamp.com) second EP, **_Remember to Remember Me_**, is a subtle display in delicate minimalism. The record features 4 tracks, which more often than not all centre on one or two  melodies. This, combined with the spacious production by friend of the site **Erik David Hidde**, gives the whole thing a weightless quality, it really does feel like the tracks could float away at any point.\n\nAway from the admittedly simple folk influenced arrangements, the lyrics and vocals offer a more emotionally meaty feast for the ears. The title track is a particular highlight. The lines **_“Love me like I’m going to die/ I’m never letting go/ no matter what you say to me/ I’ll always love you so”_**, aren’t exactly the post intricately poetic set of lines ever written. But it’s honest and eye wateringly raw.\n\nStream our 2 highlights from the EP below and grab the full EP over at Chad’s [Bandcamp.](http://chadhagans.bandcamp.com)",
