  "date": "2013-09-26T16:12:01",
  "body": "Impressing with his fantastic debut track, Drive (Part 1), Londoner **Ben Khan** has returned with new single _Eden_.\n\nYet another slice of Jai Paul inspired R&B, it further substantiates the belief that Khan is one of the most exciting young musicians around at this moment in time. Prince-esque guitar lines, slick production and an early 00’s groove, it’s another hit in waiting. With little information circulating about Khan (probably not even his real name…), and him yet to play a live show, _Eden_ is sure to have A&R’s even hotter on his heels.",
