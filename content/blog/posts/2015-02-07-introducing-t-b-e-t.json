  "body": "There are plenty of guitar bands that are happy to let their music wash over you, existing in an anesthetized state of mind as fuzzy guitar lines and wavy vocals subsist in a perceived sense of style.\n\nUpon discovering T I B E T, I encountered a band that was ferociously direct and oozing confidence in their riffs and percussion.\n\n‘She Don’t Know’ is a fast paced, joyous affair; relentless in it’s chorus declaration and unabashed through it’s tumultuous pop melodies. ‘My Girl’ is a less intense cut, and displays it’s strength and ambition in it’s undulating dynamics as anthemic choruses are bookended by phases of contrasting quietness and enveloping percussion.\n\nListen to ‘My Girl’ and ‘She Don’t Know’ below.",
