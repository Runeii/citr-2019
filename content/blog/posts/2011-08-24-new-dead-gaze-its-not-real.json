  "body": "The speed in which the artists over at the **[Cats Purring](http://www.catspurring.com/)** have been churning out beautiful pop gems is almost startling. In the last two weeks the Oxford (Mississippi) based collective has featured on the site twice, through **[Dent May](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/10227-new-dent-may-wedding-day/ \"New: Dent May – Wedding Day\")** and **[Gray Things](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/10237-new-gray-things-class/ \"New: Gray Things – Class\")** respectively. It’s now the turn of **[Dead Gaze](http://www.myspace.com/deadgazetunes)**, who’ve just announced they’re to release their new record on NY based label **Group Tightener**.
