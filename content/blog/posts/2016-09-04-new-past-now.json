  "body": "This track from NY outfit **Past You** cropped up on my radar toward the end of last week, and has been stuck on constant repeat since then.\n\nClocking in at almost seven minutes, it’s one of those tracks that just blossoms as it develops, almost feeling like a slower, more sombre version of CHVRCHES – it’s delightfully lovelorn. Immerse yourself in **With You Now **below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
