  "body": "There hasn’t been any new music from Portland’s **Malcolm Lacey,** AKA **Arrange,** for a few months now – [his incredible and heartbreaking 2011 self-release](http://arrange.bandcamp.com/album/plantation \"Arrange - Plantation\") **_Plantation_**remains one of my favourite albums of the past few years, so I was excited for word of a new track to drop into my inbox this morning. According to **Lacey,** _Callers_ has apparently “been written for almost three years,” and the track has the unpolished sound of having been picked up off the cutting (or bedroom) floor; with far fewer synths compared to the past, it’s another way of transmitting the raw emotion that **Arrange **deals in so well. Singing over guitars that slowly build in urgency, there’s something about **Lacey’s** voice that just cuts right through.
