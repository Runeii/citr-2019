  "body": "With their debut single, _Dead House_, London duo **The Dead Strange** did something rather special for me in reminding me why I used to be so in love with ‘guitar music’.\n\n_Dead House_ is a dirty, bluesy affair, complete with bouncing drum beat and swaggering, uncompromising guitar chords, hinting at the more muscular direction Arctic Monkeys showcased whilst under the direction of Josh Homme. Yet The Dead Strange don’t stop there, there’s touches of The Black Keys and 60’s psychedelic rock littered throughout the magical four minute course, making for the first great rock song of 2014.",
