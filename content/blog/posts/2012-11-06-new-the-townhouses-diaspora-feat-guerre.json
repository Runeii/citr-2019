  "body": "The rather marvelous thing about Sydney based music at the moment is the speed in which it crafts out new and interesting sounds, if you take your eyes off the city for a moment, it’s likely to have churned out a load of new tunes that results in a fairly hefty catch-up.\n\nOn the one side you have **Groundislava** style glitch through the likes of **[Bon Rat, Bon Rat](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/11278-new-bon-chat-bon-rat-cerberus/)**, **[FISHING](http://soundcloud.com/yespleaserecords/fishing-white-sheet-beach-1)** and **[Oscar Key Sung](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Oscar-Key-Sung/278250028898490)** and on the other, some rather oddly soulful material from the likes of **[Guerre](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/9032-review-guerre-darker-my-love/ \"Review: Guerre – Darker My Love\"), The Townhouses** and **[Oliver Tank](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/12712-new-oliver-tank-dreams/ \"New: Oliver Tank – Dreams\")**. As it happens **Guerrre** and **The Townhouses** have teamed up for this rather striking new cut from **Townhouses**’ new album, _The Diaspora_.\n\nThe track, also entitled The Diaspora, is a stripped down, subtly anthemic ballad that manages to sound quaintly similar to the **Cinematic Orchestra**’s ‘_To Build a Home_’.\n\n**The Townhouses** drop the _Diaspora_ album through Bandcamp and iTunes on November 20.",
