  "body": "After four viewings of this video from Vancouver BC rap duo **G3NESIS** (aka Kelin Kaardal and Genesis Mohanraj), I’ve still got several unanswered questions:\n\n1) Is the whole thing just an elaborate VICE hoax, trying to reel in those caught up in the Grimes / Kitty Pryde hype?\n\n2) How old are these girls? I’m guessing anywhere between 14 and 28.\n\nSeeing as they apparently met four years ago at art school, I’m guessing they’re out of their teens.\n\n3) Is it good / bad / horrendous? I’m genuinely unsure, either way, I’ve now racked up half a dozen listens,\n\n_tell you now, I’ll tell you later, don’t go to bed with the babysitter_\n\nCheck out the Kevan Funk directed video below.\n\n[G3NESIS – Yes Daddy](http://vimeo.com/57922771) from [Everything All At Once](http://vimeo.com/eaaonce) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
