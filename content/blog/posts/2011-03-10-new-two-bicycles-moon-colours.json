Having already donated two tracks as free downloads, the beautiful “I’m Not Afraid To Wait For You” and the more upbeat “Alone at Sea”, there’s a feeling that Two Bicycles has a real belief in the quality of their music, and quite rightly so. “Moon Colours” is a placid affair, reverb laden guitar chords shimmer gracefully; an accomplished track, showing that The Ocean has the potential to be a truly fantastic record.\n\n[Download Moon Colours](http://stadiumsandshrines.com/?p=3058)",
