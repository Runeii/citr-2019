  "body": "Since it’s beginning’s in 1994 as a series a parties held at the Union Chapel in Islington, The Big Chill festival has become known for its eclectic lineups, electric visuals and unusual acts, this year is no exception.\n\nHeld in the grounds of Eastnor Castle, Hertfordshire from the 4th to the 7th of August, The Big Chill 2011 has acts ranging from the eerily experimental Ariel Pink to hip hop mega mogul, Kanye West. Its impossible to place the festival within a single genre and alongside a magnificent music line up, there’s plenty more for festival-goers to feast their eyes, ears and mouths on.\n\nUsually in a pre roundup piece like this I’d make some recommendations of what acts I think will stand out, but with such an interesting lineup, I’m finding it hard to pick out my favourites. So I’m asking you, the reader, What do you want to see covered in Crack in the Road’s post Big Chill festival run-down?\n\nCrack in the Road will be sending myself and a femme fatale photographer down to the Big Chill to capture the atmosphere and perhaps catch up with a few of the acts, so if you don’t get a chance to attend we’ll be there letting you know how things go down. Anyway, without further ado, I present to you the line-up;\n\n_NB: There are also acts playing on the Thursday including James Blake, they aren’t listed here but you can find them on the official [Big Chill 2011 site.](http://www.bigchill.net)_\n\n**Deer Park Stage**\n\n**Friday**\n\nThe Chemical Brothers\n\nEmpire Of The Sun\n\nNeneh Cherry\n\nWild Beasts\n\nAriel Pink’s Haunted Graffiti\n\nZola Jesus\n\nHere We Go Magic\n\nElectrelane\n\nMahala Rai Banda\n\n**Saturday**\n\nKanye West\n\nJessie J\n\nMetronomy\n\nTom Middleton\n\nJanelle Monae\n\nThe Bullitts featuring Jay Electronica & Lucy Liu\n\nCrystal Fighters\n\nThe Knocks\n\n~ 2manydjs will close this stage ~\n\n**Sunday**\n\nRodrigo Y Gabriela\n\nRobert Plant and The Band of Joy\n\nWarpaint\n\nFemi Kuti & The Positive Force\n\nNorman Jay\n\nNorth Mississippi Allstars Duo\n\nSteel Pulse\n\nAbout Group\n\n~Chris Cunningham will close this stage ~\n\nSomething else about the Big Chill that caught my eye was its infamous night time art trail.
