  "title": "New: Jay Summer – Look The Part",
  "date": "2018-03-27T12:11:18",
  "body": "_Jay Summer_ is my favourite new artist.\n\nHis debut single, Clutch Burning, won over a handful of online tastemakers, and his second release, _Look the Part_, is an even more fully formed single in its own right. Again with several head nods to the likes of Frank Ocean and Rex Orange County, there’s so much personality and character to this, both in the lyrics and the unique, downright brilliant vocal delivery. Lines like ‘I see ’em hang out the sun roof / crystal champagne flutes / go up like Gatsby / Tuesday tailored luxury exclusive’ are delivered with a real air of bravado. Check it out below.",
