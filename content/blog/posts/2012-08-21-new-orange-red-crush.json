  "body": "When it comes to dreamy shoegaze inspired pop, Scandinavia seems to have the entire genre pretty locked down.\n\nWhether it’s the long, cold, dark nights or the constant state of intoxication many of their inhabitants are in (I’m looking at you, Norway), Northern Europe does wallowing and languid better than any other part of the world. Sweden’s **Orange Red**, a group who I can’t unearth much information about, fit the Scandinavian billing perfectly, with scything guitars and lofty vocals orchestrating much of their debut track, _Crush_. I tend to be a bad omen when it comes to breaking new bands, as the vast majority seem to disappear entirely, so here’s hoping **Orange Red** can build on this delightful first outing.",
