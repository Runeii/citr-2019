  "body": "One verse.\n\nEighty five seconds of music. At this moment in time, that is the only trace of Sydney based artist **FCUK Normality’s** musical existence; but what an eighty five seconds it is. _These Moments_, coming in at under a minute and a half, is a magical amalgamation of hip hop and ambient inspirations. The vocals sound scarily like **Kid Cudi**; dry yet vaguely comforting, and providing a welcome comparison to the female vocals in the latter section of the track. Sure, the lyrics are relatively cliched, from _‘Swim deep in the moments that last a life time’_ to _‘Be yourself no matter what don’t hide behind your eyes’_, however there’s something honorably warm and uplifting about it. With no Facebook, Twitter or LastFM presence adding to **FCUK Normality’s** mystic, I’m truly excited to hear more from this Australian artist.\n\nCheck out _These Moments_ below, and head to the **FCUK Normality** [bandcamp](http://fcuknormality.bandcamp.com/releases) page for a free download.\n\n<a href=\"http://fcuknormality.bandcamp.com/track/these-moments\">These Moments by Fcuk Normality</a>",
