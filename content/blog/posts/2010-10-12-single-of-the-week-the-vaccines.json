With the combined length of the two tracks coming in at little over four minutes, they appear to be aiming to capture the essence of 60s inspired indie pop.\n\nAfter taking a listen to _Do You Wanna_; the only song made previous available by the group, I was somewhat underwhelmed. Their blend of _Pet Sounds_ pop with chillwave influenced guitars sounded all too familiar, however this new single from **The Vaccines** is a vast improvement. _Wreckin’ Bar_ is a **Ramones** inspired beauty, coming in at under a minute and a half; fresh, exciting and a fantastic introduction to a band with a bright future. Whereas _Blow It Up_ is a more atmospheric affair, less out there rock, more melodic pop harmonies, not too far from the sound recently re-pioneered by **The Drums**. Watch out 2011, looks like **The Vaccines** are set to dominate the coming year.\n\n[The Vaccines Official Site](http://thevaccines.co.uk/)",
