  "date": "2012-06-05T19:54:46",
  "body": "A new track from **Giraffage** you say? Ah, the perfect remedy for those post-Festival blues.\n\nSlightly cliched vocal samples and excessive use of ‘chillwave techniques’ make up the majority of the track, yet it works brilliantly, coming across all floaty and mystical. _Feels_ is taken from an as yet untitled EP due out later in the year. Check it out below.",
