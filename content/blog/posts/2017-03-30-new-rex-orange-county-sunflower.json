  "date": "2017-03-30T16:46:13",
  "body": "Just in time for an oddly sunny April, Rex Orange County returns with his new summery single _Sunflower._\n\nOpening with a smooth jazzy intro, Rex teasers listeners with a vintage sound before taking the track down a more contemporary indie route. The production is beautifully crisp and clear with each layer of instrumental sounding bright below Rex’s soul-tinged vocals. The vocal layers and overdubs in the chorus stand out especially with smatterings of horns and a saxophone towards the end of the track making the track feel rich and vibrant. Check out Sunflower in the link below.",
