Now, flexing his own muscles on his debut solo track, a demo titled _You_, released under the moniker **Flecs**, it’s a mix between the dancefloor ready pop of **Disclosure**, and the dreamier, bedroom based ‘chillwave’, that’s become increasingly popular as of late, yet done with a composure and elegance that makes it more than worthwhile. With the pattern at the moment being to team up with vocalists, and with the quality of _You_, I’d imagine **Flecs** will have potential collaborators queuing up before too long.",
