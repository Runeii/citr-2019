  "date": "2012-04-19T15:39:23",
  "body": "It’s been a few months since we last heard from Berlin duo **Freakish Atlantic**, a period in which it appears they’ve taken a step back to carefully consider their musical future, alongside writing material for their debut LP.\n\nThis new track, _House Of Cards_, released earlier today is a delightfully Scandinavian affair, filled with wistful synths and dreamy vocals building to a shimmering crescendo, coming in somewhere between **Bon Iver** and **The Postal Service**. Judging by the strength of this new track, combined with their excellent [debut EP](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/10903-introducing-freakish-atlantic/), **Freakish Atlantic** could well be the sound of the summer.",
