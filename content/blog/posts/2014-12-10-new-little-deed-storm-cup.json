  "body": "Absolutely adored **Little Deed’s** debut track, [_NEON_](http://admin.</p><p>crackintheroad.com/music/29255-new-little-deed-neon), which saw her feature on several top sites, however I had a slight concern that it might perhaps be a flash in the pan, and that we’d never hear from her again. Thankfully, her return track, _Storm In My Cup_, is devastatingly brilliant, and surprisingly far more upbeat. Although it’s arrival at the tail end of the year might be clouding my thinking, I’m fairly happy to go on record and say this is one of my favourite songs of 2014.",
