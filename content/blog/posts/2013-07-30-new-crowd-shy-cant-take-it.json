  "body": "**Jordan Watko** aka **Crowd Shy** self-described his music as ‘the result of me spending way too much time in a tiny basement alone with my computer and an old ass keyboard’, and despite having only heard one track thus far, it seems to be a pretty legitimate summary.\n\n_Can’t Take It_ is a squelchy, Washed Out dream-pop affair, with 80’s disco influences. Taken from his debut LP, Begin To Understand, out 25 September, check out _Can’t Take It_ below.",
