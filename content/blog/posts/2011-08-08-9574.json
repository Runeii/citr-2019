  "body": "The official video for _Vomit_, the debut single from new the **Girls** album, _Father, Son, Holy Ghost,_ dropped this morning.\n\nIt’s a still, composed and ultimately saddening little film. The video, directed by **Austin Rhodes**, follows **Girls** as they trawl the streets in a bright red luxury car. Roses die in the back seat and girls of the night hunt for customers in this emotionally vacuous world, and yet the video still manages to make us feel for all involved. It visually recreates the track perfectly.\n\n_Father, Son, Holy Ghost_ will be released September 12th in the UK on Turnstile and September 13th in the US on Matador.",
