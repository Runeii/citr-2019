  "body": "By the looks of their various photographs and comments on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Haunter/152867194808189?fref=ts), Wisconsin four piece **Haunter** don’t take themselves all too seriously, however, by the strength of their recent ten track release, it’s perhaps about time that they did. Hailing from the same state as folk-pop’s biggest star, a certain Mr **Iver**, there are several similarities in the sparse instrumentation and disjointed crescendo’s that littered **Justin Vernon’s** debut LP, however **Haunter** throw a more psychedelic element into the mix, merging slightly off-putting samples and the overpowering sense of death fused with melodrama.\n\nFrom the creepy sample found on **Molly** to the uplifting chorus of _Take Me Back (To Those Times)_, **Haunter** stamp their own individual authority on each and every track on the self-titled release. There’s a gothic, sultry vibe to much of the record, yet underpined by the stunning vocals and harmonious instrumentation. Check out the full release below, in particular my highlights, _Laura Palmer_ and _The Glue_.",
