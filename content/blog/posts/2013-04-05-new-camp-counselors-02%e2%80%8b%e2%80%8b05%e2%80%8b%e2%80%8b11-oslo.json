  "title": "New: Camp Counselors – 02​/​05​/​11 / Oslo",
  "date": "2013-04-05T21:40:21",
  "body": "Having appeared little under a year ago with a [duo of debut tracks](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/16722-new-camp-counselors/), both which have since vanished from the internet, Buffalo’s **Camp Counselors** has returned, with another two gems, as well as unveiling his identity. **Kyle J. Reigle**, the individual behind Camp Counselors, has worked with **Warren Hildebrand** (better known as Foxes in Fiction), for this digital 7″. Comprised of _02​/​05​/​11_ and the instrumental track _Oslo_, it’s a dreamy, slightly distant release; absorbing yet also existing solely within its own consciousness. 02​/​05​/​11 burns slowly, as extra layers of vocals, and then percussion gradually seep in, whereas Oslo adopts a more post-rock inspired feel, toying with atmosphere to sublime effect. Check both out below.",
