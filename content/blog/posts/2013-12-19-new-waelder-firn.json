  "body": "[**W**æ**lder**](https://www.facebook.com/waeldersound) is an experimental electronic project from Vienna, Austria. Their debut EP _Firn_ has just been released, and from the opening melody of the title track you’ll feel that something pretty strange and beautiful is going on here. The duo of **Jan Preivler** and **Moritz Nahold** create ambient pop lullabies crushing into an electronic railway of industrial sounds – think **Antony Hegarty**‘s androgynous voice immersed in the chaotic electronic universe of **Haxan Cloak.** An adventurous listen, and well worth getting lost in.\n\n**Firn EP** is available for purchase in limited edition 10” vinyl and digital on their [bandcamp page](http://waelder.bandcamp.com/).\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/122295861″ params=”color=ff6600&auto\\_play=false&show\\_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]",
