  "body": "Kudos must be credited to our bro ShinyShinyNew, who has tipped us off yet again on another cracking new talent.\n\nLuxury, as far as we can tell, is the creation of Andy Smith, who is based in West London. Other than that, very little is known about Luxury, however for what we lack in biographical information, Smith has not left us short on music, as his Soundcloud boasts of five full, equally exciting tracks.\n\nRanging through a whole range of tempo, Luxury’s musical output is incredibly engaging and intriguing. Transcending periods of electronic haze and blistering moments of clarity, we await an official release from Luxury with eager anticipation.",
