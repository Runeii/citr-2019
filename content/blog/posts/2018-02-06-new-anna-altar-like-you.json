  "body": "This official debut single from LA’s **Anna Altar** (Nicole Mormann) is huge.\n\nThere’s an almost 80’s exuberance to _Like You_, it’s so majestically and exhilaratingly over the top. Comparison wise, elements of the likes of Wet, MUNA and BROODS creep in at points, as well as the sort of chorus orientated songwriting that HAIM thrive upon; yet it truly manages to carve out a niche entirely it’s own. Very excited to hear more from Anna Alter. Check out Like You below.",
