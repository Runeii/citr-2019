  "body": "Despite numerous technical difficulties, **SPLASHH**‘s set at The Great Escape was undoubtedly one of the festivals highlights.\n\nPossessing a raw, unadulterated energy that’s found in so few modern acts, there’s a reason why they’re regarded as one of the hottest new talents in the UK. New single _Need It_ is a riproaring three minutes of infectious, gritty pop; upbeat and deliriously lively. Released on LuvLuvLuv on 30 July, you can guarantee that this won’t be the last we hear from **SPLASHH**.",
