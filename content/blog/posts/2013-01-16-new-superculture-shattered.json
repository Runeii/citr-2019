  "body": "I can’t tell you much about **Superculture**; actually scratch that, I can’t tell you anything at all about them, aside from the fact that they’re from New York and have written one of the best tracks this side of ’13.\n\n_Shattered_, a song of yearning, abashment and self-depreciation features one of the best choruses you’ll hear this year, and despite it’s clearly low budget recording budget, I’d rather this than the majority of the high-end pap that seems to be doing the rounds at the moment. Check out _Shattered_ below, grab a free download, and get in touch if you have any more info on this hugely exciting act.",
