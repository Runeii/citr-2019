  "body": "It’s always refreshing when a musician takes the time to write some thoughts to go alongside their creative produce; too often are we merely presented with the bare minimum, in an attempt to come across as ‘slick’.\n\nIn the case of Nashville’s **Mason Self**, he’s penned [several paragraphs](http://thegroovedude.com/seawolf/) to accompany his newest release, a seven track extended EP of sorts, titled SEAWOLF. Listening through to the record, it’s an at times disjointed listen, swinging from the wonderfully understated _(Niner_) to gloriously over the top (_Rend_). Perhaps more experimental than the vast majority of music that ends up on CitR, I can’t help but draw comparisons to **Battles**, in the off-kilter percussion (**Alt-J** anyone?) and sheer beautiful calamity of the tracks. Anyway, check out the full release below, alongside a couple of personal highlights.",
