  "body": "Wow, am I glad I read my emails tonight.\n\nThis new track from California’s **Tree** is a wonderfully diverse affair, swinging between melancholic piano balladry, to harmonica driven folk-pop, touching on hip hop elements along the way. Sampling the sound of s ‘homies gameboy played through an arpeggiator’, you’re unlikely to hear a song as vibrant, intense or simply enjoyable as _Universal_ for the rest of the year.
