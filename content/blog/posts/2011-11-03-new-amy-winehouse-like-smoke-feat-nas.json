Nas)_ earlier today. As expected from Miss **Winehouse,** it’s a soulful number, although seemingly tragic in hindsight. Recorded back in 2008 and produced by close friend **Salaam Remi**, it was widely known that one of Amy’s life goals was to collaborate with the NY rapper, and Like Smoke is a fitting testament to a career untimely cut short. Check out _Like Smoke_ below.\n\n  \n  \n\n_**Amy Winehouse Lioness: Hidden Treasures**_ is out 5 December, with £1 from each sale going to the Amy Winehouse Foundation.",
