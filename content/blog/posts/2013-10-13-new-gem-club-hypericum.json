  "body": "Somerville trio **Gem Club** are criminally underrated.\n\nTheir 2011 album Breakers remains a sombre, rainy day beauty; that manages to come across as both utterly immersive, and somehow distant. New cut _Hypericum_ doesn’t alter the formula too much, with the fragile vocals and intimate piano sections combining with the bolder, expansive string parts. Check out _Hypericum_ below, taken from **_In Roses_**, out 28 January on Hardly Art.",
