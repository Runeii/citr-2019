  "body": "After the release of **Rejjie Snow**’s track/video, _Lost in Empathy_, the world was sold on the work of Mr.\n\nSnow. What we were lacking however was a wealth of material. This is set to change. This guest spot on Parisian producer **Andre**a’s new EP, _Cruising_, sees him at his most lyrically proficient. The beat, clearly a **xxyyxx** rework fails to pack a complete punch, but with **Rejjie**’s flows of consciousness really coming into their own, the track manages not to suffer.\n\np.s We have a **Rejjie Snow** announcement coming soon that will forcibly flip your shit.",
