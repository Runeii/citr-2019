  "body": "Wow.\n\nI’m not quite sure how this track passed me by. Made available earlier in the year via the **Nomadic Firs** [soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/nomadic-firs), _Vines_ is the most gloriously addictive three and a half minutes of psychedelic pop you’ll hear this year. Alongside the release of a video to accompany Vines, **Nomadic Firs** have also announced that their debut LP will be available via our long-time bros at [**Crash Symbols**](http://crashsymbols.tumblr.com/), which I’m sure you’ll agree is a match made in heaven. Be sure to check out the clip, which features plenty of chickens, cats and most importantly, more care free fun than you can shake a stick at. So, without further delay, press play below, and allow your feet to do the talking, I pity anyone who doesn’t find themselves driven to dance round their room like a crazed lunatic.",
