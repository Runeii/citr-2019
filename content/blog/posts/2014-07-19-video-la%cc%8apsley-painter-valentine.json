  "body": "Already one of the most talked about new artists of the year, **Låpsley’s** rise to fame is proving a rapid one.\n\nWith a debut performance at Glastonbury a couple of weeks back, and now a video released for the stunning _Painter (Valentine)_, it’s now not so much a question of if, but when. Directed by seventeen year old Harvey Pearson, adopting a similar sort of story-telling ethos as found in the work of CitR favourite Tyler T Williams (Coma Cinema, Craft Spells, Youth Lagoon), it’s a fitting tribute to the beauty of the track itself. Station / Painter (Valentine) is out now on iTunes and Spotify, where we’ve also added it to our [Crack in the Road Playlist.](http://open.spotify.com/user/joshmdalton/playlist/3kX8WBprbziibBBnX1HVp4)",
