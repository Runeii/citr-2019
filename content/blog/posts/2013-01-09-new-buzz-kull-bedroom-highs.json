  "body": "Feels like an age since we last checked in with Sydney duo **Buzz Kull**.\n\nCelebrating their one year anniversary at the turn of 2012, this scuzzy new number is gritty, sexy and everything that initially attracted us to them in the first place. Part **Jesus & Mary Chain**, part **Sonic Youth**, it’s comfortably their most complete work to date. From the slick artwork to the noticeable step up in recording quality, it’s clear that **Buzz Kull** intend to take 2013 by storm. Check out _Bedroom Highs_ below.",
