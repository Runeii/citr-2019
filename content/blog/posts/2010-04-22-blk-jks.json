With the title track **BLK JKS** step away from their usual psychedelic guitar riffs and frenetic drum solos, to produce a summery and upbeat pop song, about soccer… With “I can roll and shoot at the same time” infectiously being proclaimed over some funky bass, a distinctive african rhythm and a sun drenched guitar riff, the song fits perfectly as a soundtrack the excitement and anticipation for the World Cup in South Africa.\n\n![Zol!](http://www.secretlycanadian.com/thumbs/SC217.jpg)\n\nOn the 10th July the band will perform alongside Alicia Keys, Amadou & Mariam, Black Eyed Peas, John Legend, Shakira, Tinariwen and others as part of the **FIFA World Cup Kick Off Celebration** at Orlando Stadium in Soweto, South Africa.
