  "body": "As if I needed any further proof that sometimes the best things can be right underneath your nose, Newcastle’s **Patterns In Plastic** exploded onto my radar with their excellent [_**Balloons Don’t Always Fly**_](http://patternsinplastic.bandcamp.com/album/balloons-dont-always-fly) EP, three tracks of trippy, experimental EDM, quite unlike anything else coming from the North East at this present moment. Not only that, but the duo comprised of **Wesley Akinfolarin** and **Joe William Todd** also brought in some of their (and as it happens also my) favourite producers to try their hand at reworking the EP cuts. Featuring the likes of **Sina.**, **Module Module** and **Sun Glitters**, each remix is wonderfully crafted, with the respective artists stamping their own authority on the tracks. Check out the full release below (Sina’s reworking of Sleepyhead is my personal favourite).",
