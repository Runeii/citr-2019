  "date": "2010-05-01T21:11:22",
  "body": "Over the past year or so, **James Blake** has quickly become a real head turner within the UK underground dubstep scene, with a series of impressive releases on fashionable labels, Brain Math, Hessle Audio and Hemlock.\n\nThe 22 year old music student will soon drop a new EP on influential label R&S. The title track **CMYK** manipulates warped R&B samples, synths and an complex array of keys, echoes and washes to create a truly original, melodic banger. Expect to hear this track being played a lot over the next few months.\n\nThe full EP will be released on R&S Records on May 31st.\n\n[Listen to CMYK.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQoQirZwxE4)\n\n[Myspace.](http://www.myspace.com/jamesblakeproduction)",
