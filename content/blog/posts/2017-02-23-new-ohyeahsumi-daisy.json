  "body": "It took me a couple of listens to really get under the skin of this debut single from LA twin sister duo **Ohyeahsumi** (Rena and Lena Vernon), but once I did, I was hooked.\n\nMinimal yet deeply affecting, it’s a truly enchanting listen, that feels like it draws as much from The Cure as it does Mitski. _Daisy_ is lifted from their debut EP out March 31 via Sports Day Records. Check it out below.",
