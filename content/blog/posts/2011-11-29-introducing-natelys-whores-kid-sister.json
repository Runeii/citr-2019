  "body": "If there’s one way for a band to endear themselves to an obsessive bookworm before said bookworm has even heard a note from them, it’s by naming themselves after a relatively minor character in some work of literature or other.\n\nAnd while this particular bookworm had heard _Fix My Corrections_, penultimate track from **Nately’s Whore’s Kid Sister**‘s latest EP **_Ribs_**, before he registered their name, his noting the _Catch-22_ related moniker about halfway through the song certainly didn’t do any harm to his estimations of the band.\n\n [04 Fix my corrections](http://soundcloud.com/nwkidsister/fix-my-corrections) by [NWKidSister](http://soundcloud.com/nwkidsister)\n\n_Fix My Corrections_‘ greyedout clank and bottomfeeding rumble had already spoken for themselves, however, and the worm was hooked. So. Just who the fuck are Nately’s Whore’s Kid Sister?\n\nAs it turns out, they’re Jim, John, Matt, Stuart and Michael from Newcastle Upon Tyne, five young adult males who sound like they exist on a diet of booze, blunts and raw beef. To call _**Ribs**_ heavyweight would be an understatement, but at risk of sounding like pretty much every toilet band ever’s press release, there’s a second head to this chipped ol’ battleaxe. _Just Below the Ribs_, which opens proceedings, encapsulates neatly the appeal of Nately’s. It’s those doomy moments on Soundgarden’s **_Superunknown_**, played by Red Sparowes fans on Telecasters, stretched out over seven minutes and sung by Seraphim. It’s lovely, but it’s horrible. Something like Edmund Burke’s notion of the Sublime, if I’ve remembered my schoolin’ right.\n\nElsewhere, _Babies_ and _Regards, Bison_ forego their predecessor’s warped beauty for deadweighted and snarling disgust, whilst _Man outside Cumberland Arms, Byker, 11/07/11_ is nothing short of utterly terrifying. I don’t know which one of Nately’s had the stones to risk making the field recording that runs through the song like poisoned blood, but he’s a bigger man than I.\n\nIf you’re from the band’s presumably grim northern climes, you should probably make yer way over to The Tyne Bar on the twelfth night of December, for a four pound night of festive cheer entitled [Fuck Christmas](https://www.facebook.com/#!/event.php?eid=197864416962330 \"Yeah man, fuck that shit man. Yeah man. \"). Like all young and aspiring darlings of doom, Nately’s are consummate advocates of that social networking thang. You can find them [here](http://nwkidsister.bandcamp.com/ \"Mancamp\"), [here](http://nwks.tumblr.com/ \"Grumblr\"), [here](https://www.facebook.com/nwkidsister \"Disgracebook\") and [here](http://www.myspace.com/natelyswhoreskidsister \"Wouldn't hurt a flyspace\").\n\n**_Ribs_** is up for digital release on Christmas Day. We can only hope that somehow, it’ll make its way into a cathedral.",
