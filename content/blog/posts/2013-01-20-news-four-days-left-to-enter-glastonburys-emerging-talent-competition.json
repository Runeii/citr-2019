Well this year the folks at Glastonbury Festival are once again looking for new, unsigned artists from the UK and Ireland.\n\nThe winning artist chosen by UK bloggers and a panel of judges is given a main stage slot at this year’s Glastonbury… that means you’re basically as big as the Beatles.\n\nA panel of 40 of the UK’s best music bloggers will pull together a longlist of the top 120 entries. This longlist will brutally cut down to a shortlist of just eight artists by a panel of industry judges including Glastonbury organisers Michael and Emily Eavis. It’s then down to the live finals in Pilton in April to decide this year’s emerging talent.\n\nApplications opened at 9am on Thursday 17th January and will remain open until this Thursday,the 24th. Enter now on the [official Glastonbury website](http://glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/news/emerging-talent-competition-2013-enter-now \"ETC Competition - new bands, Glastonbury\").",
