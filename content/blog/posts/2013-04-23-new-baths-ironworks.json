  "body": "There’s an irresistible childlike element to the music of **Baths**, that makes listening to him so utterly enthralling.\n\nBe it the choppy, **Casiotone For The Painfully Alone** style vocals or the almost **Fly-Lo** reminiscent percussion, it’s devastatingly beautiful and bizarrely sensual. Ironworks, the second track to be taken from **_Obsidian_**, his forthcoming follow-up to 2010’s **_Cerulean_**, twists and turns, with the vocals wriggling tempestuously throughout. Check it out below, and watch out for Obsidian when it drops on 28 May via [Anticon](http://www.anticon.com/).",
