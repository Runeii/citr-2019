  "body": "The recording moniker of ‘Jennifer D’ from San Francisco, **spells** appears to be a relatively new project, yet built upon previous musical experiences.\n\nAs with New York songstress **Eddi Front**, there’s touches of classical training, in both the vocals and the instrumentation, be it the sultry piano lines or more extravagant booming synths. Tracks like _exits_ and _fader_ showcase the enigmatic, and cryptic side to spells, forlorn and lusting in equal measures, it’s considered, controlled and discretely fragile. With four tracks to her name so far, forming a mightily exciting introduction to spells, it’ll be fascinating to see what she conjures up next.",
