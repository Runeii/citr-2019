  "body": "I’d never really given Local Natives too much of a chance, but given the strength of this new track, taken from their forthcoming record _Hummingbird_ out next year, I may have to delve into their back catalogue.\n\nSo it treads the ever so tender tightrope between **Arcade Fire** and **Foals** with it’s epic grandeur and intimate guitar lines, it’s tailor made to be remixed into an indie dancefloor hit, yet it’s still one of the best songs of 2012 thus far. Check out Breaking below, and keep an eye out for _Hummingbird_, out 28 January.",
