  "body": "Perhaps a few days late with this one, but as [**London Grammar**’s](https://soundcloud.com/londongrammar) debut (sort of) track, _Hey Now_, sits on my browser getting played more and more, it would be increasingly silly not to post it. It’s a blindingly acute example of an effortlessly superb pop track. Built up with a beautiful melody that slowly sinks into consciousness and repeated exclamations of guilt, loss and sadness, it could never be accused of being complex. But what it lacks in dexterity, it makes up for in honesty, it’s that dumbfounded “_hey now_” that repeatedly pulls the punches. A repeated sense of betrayal that provokes such a repeated unsatisfactory reaction, at the time though it’s all one can muster.",
