Boasting one of the most impressive line-ups of any independent festival in the UK, including the likes of former _**CitR**_ interviewees **A Place To Bury Strangers**, **Blood Red Shoes** and **We Were Promised Jetpacks**, there is no doubt that this event is one not to miss.\n\nSo in anticipation of this sure to be brilliant night, _**CitR**_ will be bringing you a daily tip on who to check out at the festival. Our first recommendation are Brooklyn based indie band **The** **Antlers**, fronted by **Peter Silberman**. Originally a solo performer, **Silberman** decided to recruit a full band to record his third album; last years critically acclaimed _Hospice_, which tells the story of a man witnessing a cancer patient’s struggle with the emotional and physical pain of the illness. After the initial success of the album, **Silberman** and co. signed with French independent label **Kiss Records** who re-released _Hospice_ in early August last year. Combining intricate lyrics and beautiful vocals harmonies, **The** **Antlers** are set to be one of the bands of the evening.\n\n[Check Out The Antlers Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/theantlers)\n\n[Buy Tickets For Stag And Dagger](http://www.staganddagger.com/)",
