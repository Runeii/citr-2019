I'm getting really bored of spelling these out for you.\")** (also instrumental in running the fantastic New Cross-based Clinic collective) to produce a video for the album track _My First Castle_. The song introduces some surprising influences to the mix (**Talking Heads**, anyone?) that may leave fans of debut full length **_Our First American Friends_**‘ heavily guitar-driven sound scratching their heads, but that’s **Tubelord** I guess, and frankly, the results speak for themselves. **Tubelord**‘s website can be found [here](http://asktubelord.com/ \"I'm not even going to dignify that with a response. \").\n\n[Tubelord ≈ My First Castle](http://vimeo.com/29038278) from [Sean Roy Parker](http://vimeo.com/ahohwhy) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).",
