  "body": "Since joining **Grizzly Bear** way back in late 2004, **Chris Taylor** has featured evermore prominently within the Seattle group’s work.\n\nFrom initially only participating in the live performances, to producing their most recent record, **Taylor’s** importance within the outfit is not to be underestimated. However, with _**Dreams Come True**_ he’s chosen to go it alone, attempting to prove his own worth as a musician and songwriter.\n\nWhere **Grizzly Bear** clung to their folk and entirely natural aesthetics, **CANT** experiments with a more electronically focused sound. The tribal beat experienced on album opener _Too Late Too Far_ epitomizes this, covertly blended with **Taylor’s** softly delivered vocals. The synths are dominant and almost overly simplistic, yet they work impeccably. It’s difficult to review a side-project without drawing comparisons to the work of the musicians premier outfit, and whilst _**Dreams Come True**_ doesn’t completely distance itself from the work of **Grizzly Bear**, it would be unjust to pigeonhole **CANT** as an inferior project.\n\nAfter just a few listens it’s clear that **Taylor** borrows sounds from other indie-pop backed artists; there’s the **Twin Shadow** styled _Believe_ and the gentle acoustic number _She Found A Way Out_, which both are purposefully unoffensive pop tracks. Much of the instrumentation harks back to the sounds of the early 80’s, in it’s unabashed simplicity and standard chord patterns. Everyone knows that **Grizzly Bear** are one of the pioneers of subtle, and **Taylor** proves he’s possibly a vital element to this, the delicately non-intrusive _Bang_ highlighting this perfectly. As it slowly builds, **Taylor’s** vocals gain more and more power, before mourning ‘**cross your heart, you’ve lost control again**‘; melancholic yet hopeful.\n\nSince joining **Grizzly Bear** way back in late 2004, **Chris Taylor** has featured evermore prominently within the Seattle group’s work.

As expected from **Taylor**, the production and instrumentation is impeccable, the reverb drowned _Answer_ being perhaps the only major blip, which suffers from over exaggeration, particularly on the vocals. Whilst many artists thrive under the pretense of their parent project, **CANT** could possibly do without the **Grizzly Bear** name being branded across it, as with _**Dreams Come True**_, **Taylor** has fashioned an adorably charming and sonically pleasing record.",
