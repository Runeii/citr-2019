  "date": "2013-03-27T20:19:36",
  "body": "Fresh from playing an official SXSW show alongside the likes of Ryan Hemsworth, **Daedelus** and **Shlohmo**, LA producer **Groundislava** has dropped his newest remix, a re-working of Katy Perry’s _Wide Awake_.\n\nAs with his previous remixes and original tracks, it’s a headfuck of chopped vocal samples and heart racing percussion. Maintaining the key ‘pop’ backbone of the song, **Groundislava** turns a chart topping tune into one far more likely to be heard at the slickest SXSW parties. Tell all your friends.",
