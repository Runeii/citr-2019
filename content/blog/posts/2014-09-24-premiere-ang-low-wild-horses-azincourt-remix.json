  "body": "Parisian duo **Azincourt** (Alexandre de Saint-André and Guillaume Lhermitte) flip ANG LOW’s recent single, _Wild Horses_, into a brilliantly bonkers, time-signature hopping 80’s dance number.\n\nArguably bolder and more playful than the original, it’s the choruses that really make this remix, centred around the smile-inducing tempo change; you’re unlikely to hear a more inventive rework this year. Check it out below, alongside the original, out 27 October through Super Recordings.",
