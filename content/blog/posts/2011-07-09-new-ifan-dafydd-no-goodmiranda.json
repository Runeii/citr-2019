Seems unlikely, and after **Abeano** themselves dug a little deeper it became clear that the story wasn’t perhaps so mysterious. That hasn’t stopped Dafydd being a subject of intrigue however. His music has a very similar style to the early **James Blake** remixes, taking well known tunes, from the likes of **Amy Winehouse**, and turning them into something altogether more jerky and dazed. Check out the 2 tracks below.\n\n [Ifan Dafydd – No good (Original)](http://soundcloud.com/svimp/ifan-dafydd-no-good) by [Svimp](http://soundcloud.com/svimp)\n\n [Ifan Dafydd – Miranda](http://soundcloud.com/overmuziek/ifan-dafydd-miranda) by [overmuziek](http://soundcloud.com/overmuziek)",
