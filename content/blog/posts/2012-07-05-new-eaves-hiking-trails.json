  "body": "[**Eaves**](https://www.facebook.com/eavesmusic), the project of seventeen year old **Rick Fair** from LA possesses numerous admirable qualities, most notably talent and youthfulness. Experimenting and toying with sounds and samples in the knowledge that he has age on his side, his new EP _**Hiking Trails**_ is a varied and intriguing collection of tracks. My personal highlight being the narcotic EP title track, available to stream below. Grab the full EP from his [Bandcamp](http://eavesmusic.bandcamp.com/).",
