  "body": "Seems like a long time since **Eddi Front** made [her debut](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/16124-new-eddi-lines-gigantic/) on these very pages, and in that time she’s announced the release of her [first EP](http://bestfitrecordings.com/), details of her premiere show (tomorrow, [info here](www.communionmusic.co.uk/2012/10/eddi-front-debut-ep-london-show/)) and been featured on all of the internets slickest music blogs. In this, her first official video, she’s found in a contemplative, bleak mood, with the absence of colour and sinister subject matter echoing the sultry vibe of the track. Wearing a sleek almost wedding-style dress, she looks as beautiful and alluring as ever, matching the sensational nature of the song itself.",
