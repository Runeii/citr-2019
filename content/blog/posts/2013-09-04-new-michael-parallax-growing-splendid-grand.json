  "date": "2013-09-04T01:16:25",
  "body": "**Michael Parallax** has been making beautiful music for several years now, with his [Bandcamp](http://michael-parallax.bandcamp.com/) discography proving mightily impressive. Having shot to blog-fame recently as one half of Florida duo [**Saes**](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/23192-introducing-saes/), **Michael Parallax** has released two new tracks of his own, stunning, folk-orientated _Growing Splendid_, and the more experimental, electronic, Grand. Lyrically, these two tracks are as accomplished as ever, “_I don’t talk to ghosts. I can still see them._  \n_I can hear them laugh at me when I’m talking to the ceiling_” (Growing Splendid) and “_You’ll be the wave of the ocean / I’ll be the path of emotion”. _Check out both tracks below.",
