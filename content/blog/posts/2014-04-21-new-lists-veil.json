  "body": "It’s been over three months since we last heard from Edinburgh singer/songwriter Lists (Ali Milesi), with his debut effort ‘Autumn’ completely bowling us over with it’s fragile intensity and dazzling composition.\n\nReturning today with the understated release of his second track, entitled ‘Veil’, Lists has demonstrated his ability to craft his heart achingly beautiful sound into a weave of sorrowful violin, driving percussion, and choral vocals before then climaxing in a striking solo vocal line that will capture your entire attention.\n\nThis is very promising work from the young Scotsman, and we can’t wait to hear more.",
