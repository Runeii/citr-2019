  "body": "Fallen head over heels in love with this searingly honest debut EP from Worthing’s **Bacchus**.\n\nBeautifully composed, from the opening pangs of _The Place We Loved_, to the euphoric EP highlight, _Hope_, he lays everything out on the table, with an admirable candor. Since hitting play a few days ago, I’ve been trying to work out who the key comparison is, but can’t quite pin it down. There’s elements of Elbow, the recently unearthed RAINES, and even the more poignant moments on the new Mumford album. A truly remarkable listen. Check out a couple of EP highlights below.\n\nFollow our [Spotify On Repeat playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a hand-picked selection of the current hottest tracks.",
