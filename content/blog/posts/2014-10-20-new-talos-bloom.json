  "body": "**Talos** has been quiet for a while now; that’s not to say that he’s not been working hard behind the scenes, throwing in the occasional live show now and then (including one at Ireland’s invite only Mountain Dew Festival – which I’ve been assured was a real ‘moment’).\n\nWith year end lists beginning to come together, his latest track Bloom deserves to feature on best singles of the year lists. Produced by Ian Ring of Young Wonder, it’s a delicate lovelorn ballad, as beautiful as anything else released this year. Check out _Bloom_ below, released via Feel Good Lost on 1 December.",
