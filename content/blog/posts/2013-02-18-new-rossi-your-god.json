  "body": "If I’d put together a Sound of 2013 playlist, Nashville duo Rossi, comprised of **Kendall Morgan** and **Thom Donovan**, would have been right up there.\n\nNot for the fact that I tink they’ll be selling out Wembley Arena by the end of the year, but because they’re one of the most exciting, intoxicating acts around. Having covered their two debut tracks last year, in the form of the alluring [Ossetia](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14429-new-rossi-ossetia/) and the simply stunning [War Within](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14803-new-rossi-war-within/), it’s fantastic to hear from the group again, on new track Your God. With **Morgan’s** vocals as impeccable as ever, and the production as crisp and inviting as you can ask for, it’s another track just crying out to be used on the latest ‘cool’ American TV show; and I love it for that.",
