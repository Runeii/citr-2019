  "date": "2016-01-12T14:39:03",
  "body": "As long term fans of Aurora, and our more recent discovery Hasta, we’re stoked to premiere this superb remix of ‘Runaway’.\n\nCrafting subtle and nuanced shifts from the original track, Hasta captures the key essence of fragility and matches it with galvanising euphoric swells. Given Aurora’s natural vocal strength, the remix focuses more on clever moments of scything synths and smooth percussion lines, resulting in a finished article that is both a testament to the original song and very much interesting in it’s own right.\n\nAurora’s debut album ‘All My Demons Greeting Me as a Friend’ is out on the 11th March, and Hasta has just recently released his debut EP, ‘Bontanique’, on Kitsune.",
