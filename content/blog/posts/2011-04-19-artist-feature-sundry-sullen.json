His work jumps from medium to medium in a heartbeat, yet still carries with it a succinct message and theme. From His photography to his maze like collages, he explores the essence of the environments of cultures around him. Taking found images he creates whimsical and surreal landscapes that perform a fictitious patchwork of a lost culture.\n\nIt’s when his work is juxtaposed with modern day life however that it really shines. His experimentation with street art gives the work an extra dimension, this combined with the heavily coloured way the work is shot, results in a truly delirious relic being created. Check out his work in the slideshow above, and if you want to know more check out his [website.](http://main.sundrysullen.com)\n\n**Parallelogram**\n\nSunrise at the edge  \nof Okanogan Valley  \nTonasket hills  \nOmak mountain.High desert plain,  \ndry golden brush,  \nviolet painted sky  \nmirrored on a lake swept by two swans,  \nmirrored unto itself,  \nmarking the water with a perfect quantum pattern.  \nScience magicians love to quantify,  \nand with good measure.\n\nReflect the reflected and thou shalt find oneself  \nstanding in a mirror, peering at god.\n\nThe sky is a blanket of cotton clouds,  \ncovering our arrival  \nas we breathe our first breathe,  \nlie screaming outside the womb  \nin a new.\n\nThe water ripples, our eyes blink.  \nParallelogram,  \nparallel universe.  \nThe trees are our lungs  \nand the earth our mother.\n\n_Written by Sundry Sullen_",
