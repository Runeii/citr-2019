  "body": "Photo: Krysta Brayer\n\nThis fantastic debut single from Seattle / Portland duo **Eugene Marie** (Lucy and Spencer) is the perfect blend of Björk’s unconventional left field exuberance, and Sylvan Esso’s odd-pop earworms.\n\nInspired by a chance encounter that Lucy had with a woman in the street, which forms the lyrical centre piece of the track, They Scared is blisteringly unique and one of the most exciting debut tracks I’ve heard in quite some time. Part of an EP expected later in the year, here’s hoping the rest of their releases are as ambitious and genre-bending. Check out They Scared below. Eugene Marie play a show for Sofar Sounds in New York on [4 Feb](http://eugenemarie.com/tour/events/2017/2/4/sofar-sounds-nyc).",
