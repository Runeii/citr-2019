  "body": "With James Blake seemingly on a creative walkabout, leaving a moody-singer/songwriter sized hole to fill, Irish duo **Ryan Vail** have stepped up to the plate with their new track _Fade_.\n\nSlotting in effortlessly between The XX and the aforementioned Blake, it’s a gorgeous composition, perfectly matching the melancholic vocals with the swirling, majestic yet minimal instrumentation. A slow-burner that explodes into life towards it’s final couple of minutes, it’s elegant and wonderfully considered; it’s the musical equivalent of those cold-nights when you can see your own breath.",
