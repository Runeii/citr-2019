  "body": "Northern darlings **Let’s Buy Happiness** return with new single _Works Better On Paper_, accompanied by this rather cutesy video.\n\n**Sarah Hall’s** **Feist**\\-esque vocals are as remarkable as ever, whilst the songwriting is sombre and melancholic, yet a clear progression from previous material. Featuring numerous shots of the various band members looking pensive and slightly dejected, set against homely yet deliberately emotionally provocative backdrops, the video is elegant shot and cut together. Check it out below.",
