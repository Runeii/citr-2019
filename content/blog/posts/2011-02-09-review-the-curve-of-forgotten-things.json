Some address the medium as a chance for story telling and experimentation, others focus only on the garments in a way that fails to engage individuals that don’t happen to follow the world of fashion.

Oh and Deerhunter happen to have done the soundtrack. Check it out bellow.\n\n[Elle Fanning: Rodarte’s Muse](http://www.nowness.com/day/2011/2/8/1302/elle-fanning-rodartes-muse) on [Nowness.com](http://www.nowness.com).",
