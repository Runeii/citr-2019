  "date": "2017-12-20T01:43:22",
  "body": "This track from Australia’s **Grace Turner** really caught me at the right time.\n\nEmotionally raw yet somehow resilient, _Angry_ manages to perfectly capture the sort of distressing pain that comes with loving someone, yet never being able to get it right. Part Sharon Van Etten, part Angel Olsen, there’s a real personality to the songwriting that shines through, and makes it all the more beautiful. Check out Angry below.\n\n_‘So will we ever be friends / or is this really the end?_\n\n**_I loved you the most_**‘",
