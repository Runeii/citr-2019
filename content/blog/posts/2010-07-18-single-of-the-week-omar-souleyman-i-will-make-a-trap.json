With a discography of more than five-hundred studio and live- recorded cassette albums under his belt, ‘established’ is perhaps the most appropriate if not boring way to describe Souleyman. His music however is anything but, none more so than the classic ‘I Will Make a Trap’. Full of frantic rhythms, reverberating keys and raucous vocals, this record from last years ‘Dabke 2020: Folk and Pop Sounds of Syria’ is a fitting if not slightly obscure tune for the summer.\n\n[Omar Souleyman’s Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/omarsouleyman)",
