  "body": "Brisbane’s **Eves the Behavior** has seriously got the hang of absolutely nailing huge choruses.\n\nHer ‘debut’ single of sorts, TV, proved one of this years most addictive offerings, and her newest cut, _Electrical_, follows a similar path. Not a million miles from several of the tracks from Sky Ferreira’s 2013 debut album, it’s another promising step forward for Hannah Karydas.\n\nFollow our [Spotify On Repeat playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a selection of the current hottest tracks.",
