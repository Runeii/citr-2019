  "body": "**From Hadria** are a duo hailing from Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and with their debut track _Butterfly Effect_ they conjure up a gorgeously enticing soundscape.\n\nPart **Portishead**, part **Massive Attack**, the vocals are spaciously lush and the dubstep influenced beat is pleasantly relaxing. In terms of more recently hyped artists, it’s lightly comparable to the likes of **Purity Ring** and **Keep Shelly In Athens**, with **Butterfly Effect** proving sensual and numbingly addictive; just a shame this is all the duo have to offer so far. Stream _Butterfly Effect_ below, and download it for free via the **From Hadria** bandcamp.\n\n<a href=\"http://fromhadria.bandcamp.com/track/butterfly-effect\">Butterfly Effect by From Hadria</a>",
