With twenty six beautiful, twisted and unflinchingly unique tracks on his [soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/0point1), it’s not as if there’s a lack of material to dive into, and certainly no omission of quality. New track _Worm/Child Sing-A-Long_ is a gorgeous, atmospheric number, playing to Streckfuss’s sampled angelic vocals and deep synth lines, almost like Sigur Ros meeting Balam Acab. If you haven’t already, I thoroughly recommend that you immerse yourself in the music of **0.1**.\n\n<a href=\"http://zeropiontone.bandcamp.com/track/worm-child-sing-a-long\">worm/child sing-a-long by 0.1</a>",
