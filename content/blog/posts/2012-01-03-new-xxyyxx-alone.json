  "body": "This new(ish) cut from Orlando producer **xxyyxx** kinda reminds me of **James Blake’s** early work, in it’s spacious feel and soulful inclinations.\n\nPlaying much upon the use of well-timed silences within the music, as well as pitch-shifted vocals that prey upon the previously mentioned more minimal moments. It’s relatively simplistic in make-up, far lacking the complexity of many of **xxyyxx’s** peers (**Balam Acab** for example), yet it doesn’t feel lacking at all, and thrives upon it’s elegant composition. Check out _Alone_ below.\n\n [XXYYXX//Alone](http://soundcloud.com/xxyyxx/xxyyxx-alone) by [xxyyxx](http://soundcloud.com/xxyyxx)",
