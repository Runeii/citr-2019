With the LP now released **Groundislava’s** full potential has been realised. Taking influences from hip-hop, 8bit beats and dubstep; the music has a foot firmly in popular culture while still reaching for new worlds and sounds. It’s almost like a hi-fi soundtrack to an 80’s video game that was never released. It’s a sound that drips with nostalgia while hopefully looks forward. One of the LP’s highlights, **Panorama**, also features the fantastic **Jake Weary** and also happens to be our single of the week. Enjoy the next 6 days of your life.\n\n [Ground Is Lava – Panorama (ft.
