Why Aren’t You Naked In My Bed Now?’.\n\nPutting aside the slightly worrying fact that the majority of these pages were probably made by 13 year old girls and back to the music…\n\nOakland duo **In Bed** are very much in the C86 legacy, especially the likes of The Pastels or The Shop Assistants; all drowsy guitars and dreamy female vocals. Between their two tracks, _Happy_ and the self-titled number, Jordan and Brittney do more than enough to convince us of their potential. Check out both tracks below, and for godsake, don’t search for their Facebook page.",
