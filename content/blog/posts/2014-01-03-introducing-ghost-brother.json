It’s a mixture of compelling vocals, traditional instrumentals (notably the keyboard and guitar), and raw electronics. “World of Magic” is a perfect example of their usage of all of those elements in order to create a bizarre track _that works_.\n\nHaving just released their first tracks within the past month, I’m excited to see what else this group has in store.\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/120774214″ params=”color=ff6600&auto\\_play=false&show\\_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]\n\n**Edit: **A quick Google of the name ‘Govinda Clayton’, taken from Ghost Brother’s Soundcloud, throws up this result: http://music.cbc.ca/#/artists/Ghostbrothers\n\nSeems Ghost Brother might just be the new incarnation of a different band. Definitely a change for the better….",
