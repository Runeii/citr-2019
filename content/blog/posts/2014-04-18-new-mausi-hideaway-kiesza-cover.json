  "body": "It’s the time of year when festivals begin to announce the most interesting aspect of their line-ups; the ‘new music’ sections.\n\nIt’s always fascinating to see which festivals are really ahead of the curve when booking emerging talent, and if there’s one name that deserve to be on every festival billing this summer it’s **Mausi**. With their summer ready anthems and one of the strongest live sets around, there are few ‘new’ acts who get the crowd moving in quite the same way. Picking up **Kiesza’s** soon-to-be number one single, _Hideaway_, the Milan-via-Newcastle quartet add their own bubblegum-pop stamp, infectious and just as danceable as the original.",
