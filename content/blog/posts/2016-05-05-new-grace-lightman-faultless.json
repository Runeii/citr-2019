  "date": "2016-05-05T18:10:49",
  "body": "**Grace Lightman’s** debut track, _Vapour Trails_, was one of 2015’s highlights, and whilst new music has been in the works for a while, she’s kept her cards close to her chest.\n\nFaultless, her first offering of this year, is an ethereal, slow burning number, yet feels far more ambitious than many of her contemporaries, both in structure and production, whilst putting utmost focus on her simply otherworldly vocal.
