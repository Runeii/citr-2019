  "body": "Unfolding to the sound of a dreamy, honest narrative, **Female**‘s Clouds is a lesson in pure, sobering reality making a track all the more enticing.\n\nDriven by a shattering beat, the clean, yet undeniably complex, makeup of the song is testimony to the skill possessed by the 17 year old Melbourne-faring guy behind the pseudonym.\n\nWith his _Study EP_ set for release later this month and even more promising collaborations lined up for release at a later date, Clouds is just the beginning for Female. But it’s also the perfect primer to the intricacy of Female’s music, where the modest makeup of the track is used to take the listener to a new, heightened level.\n\nIncredible.",
