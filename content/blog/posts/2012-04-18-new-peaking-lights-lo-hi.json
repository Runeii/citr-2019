  "date": "2012-04-18T15:31:03",
  "body": "Last year’s surprise package **Peaking Lights** return with their first new material of 2012 with the psychedelic _LO HI_.\n\nFeaturing ‘vocal’ samples from **Mikko**, the baby boy of the duo (oh no they’ve gone all Blue Ivy on us), _LO HI_ is also the first single to be taken from their forthcoming record entitled _**Lucifer**_ out 18 June on Mexican Summer. It’s a slightly disjointed journey through the ever-changing world of **Peaking Lights**, combining their previous sounds with a denser, more all encompassing atmosphere. Check out _LO HI_ below and head [here](http://www.lucifer.fm/) for more information on _**Lucifer**_.\n\nVia [Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com/news/46194-listen-peaking-lights-lo-hi/)",
