  "body": "Being away from writing about ‘new’ music for the past month has really allowed me to take a step back and realise that there’s just too much of it.\n\nSure, writing about ‘buzzy’ new music is great for website hits, but doesn’t give anywhere near the same level of self-fulfilment as the reaction to an artist seeing the first ever piece written about their creations. Canada five piece **Small Town Lungs** aren’t the slickest sounding outfit you’ll hear this week; the recording is at times rough round the edges (those vocals though…), but there’s definitely something pretty bold here. _Golden Thread_ may at times be a little Bastille-esque and the drumming feels quite WU LYF inspired, but it’s the confidence and maturity that is most striking. Certainly enough here to suggest that Small Town Lungs are well worth keeping an eye on.",
