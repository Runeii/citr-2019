  "body": "Hailing from Brooklyn, the finest place for new music in the entire world, **Christen Cappello** aka **Club Girls** creates some of the most raucous yet enchanting pop around.\n\n The opening thirty seconds or so of her new single _Fly Ready_ acts as a form of ice-breaker for what’s to come; twisted vocals and harsh percussion sections give way to a lavish hook. Drawing the respectable elements of Little Boots’ slick, electro-pop and the adorable chaos found amidst the likes of Mozart’s Sister and Grimes, Club Girls has ambition, talent and ingenuity in abundance. Check out Fly Ready below, the B-side to her recent single [I Can Do A Lot](http://clubgirls.bandcamp.com/album/i-can-do-a-lot).",
