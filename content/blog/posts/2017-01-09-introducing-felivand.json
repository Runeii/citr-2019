  "body": "I stumbled across the Soundcloud of Brisbane’s **FELIVAND** a little while back and got lost for a few hours.\n\nWhilst raw at times, there are some stunning ideas littered amongst the collection of tracks and ambient snippets – none of which quite feel fully formed, yet manage to portray a distinct sense of personality – not least through her stunning vocal. Soulful at points (the 90 second long _Take It Back_), gritty at others (the King Krule-esque _My Roof_) – it’s early days however there’s more than enough here to get excited about – and perhaps more importantly, there feels to be a real progression from the older tracks to the newer. It’s rare for an artist to have such a coherent, unique songwriting style at such a young age. Check out a few tracks below.",
