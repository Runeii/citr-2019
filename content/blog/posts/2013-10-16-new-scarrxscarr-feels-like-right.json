  "date": "2013-10-16T20:57:40",
  "body": "One play after seven days of being online? Internet hype machine, you’re letting me down.\n\nThis excellent ‘debut’ track (I say that as **scarrXscarr** has featured on CitR previously, under another name), from San Francisco’s **scarrXscarr** is a bold first outing, experimenting with a very current R&B / indie sound. Layered vocals and smooth synths dominate this self-described ‘primal / mood pop’, with touches of SOHN and The Weeknd littered throughout. Check out _Feels Like You Were Right_ below.",
