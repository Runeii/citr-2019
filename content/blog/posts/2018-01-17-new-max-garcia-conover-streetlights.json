  "title": "New: Max García Conover – Streetlights",
  "date": "2018-01-17T19:22:30",
  "body": "**Max García Conover** released one of last years most underrated records, in the form of _Motorhome_.\n\nHis storytelling ability really shines on every composition, most notably the heart-wrenchingly raw Fire On i295, and his latest track whilst sees a deviation in sound, is no less majestic. Described as being “about memory — the beautiful, tragic capacity we have for carrying around little remnants of ourselves”, it’s almost Springsteen-esque as points, yet soaked in an almost John Hughes sense of romanticism. Check it out below.",
