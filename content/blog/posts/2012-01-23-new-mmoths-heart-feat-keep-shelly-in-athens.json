  "body": "The Irish electronic music scene is flourishing at the moment; from the retro-pop vibe of **[Solar Bears](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13651-new-solar-bears-alpha-people-feat-keep-shelly-in-athens/)**, to the minimal beauty of **[REID](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/12878-new-reid-genesis-forrest/)** (not to mention the touching/hilarious honesty of **[Toby Kaar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=143qRMvCBPU)**), it’s fair to say that Ireland has musical talent in abundance at the moment. Therefore, it’s not surprise to learn that **Sarah** of **Keep Shelly In Athens** has chosen to work with another of Ireland’s hottest producers, this time lending her vocals to a reworking of **Mmoths** epic number _Heart_ (formerly known as _<3_). As with **Solar Bears**, the production is of the highest order, truly allowing **Sarah’s** vocals to breath a life of their own into the track. Heavy on the reverb, it’s indescribably elegant, proving another of this years early highlights.\n\n [HEART (FEAT. KEEP SHELLY IN ATHENS)](http://soundcloud.com/mmoths/heart-feat-keep-shelly-in) by [MMOTHS](http://soundcloud.com/mmoths)",
