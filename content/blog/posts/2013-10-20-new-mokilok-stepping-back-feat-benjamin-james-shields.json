  "date": "2013-10-20T01:41:47",
  "body": "Yet more slick, electronic music from Australia, **Mokilok** aka producer **Reede Reynolds** impresses on his heavily R&B orientated debut track, _Stepping Back_.\n\nFeaturing the vocals of **Benjamin James Shields**, _Stepping Back_ has everything; groovy synth sections and an almost danceable beat, all topped off by Shields’ vocals. Comparison wise it’s a difficult one – I won’t be shocked if you’d told me that Bondax or Lapalux had produced this, it has that sort of vibe, and certainly that level of quality. Check out _Stepping Back_ below.",
