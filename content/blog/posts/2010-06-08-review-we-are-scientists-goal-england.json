Whilst in previous years, there are been a few half decent World Cup related songs; _World In Motion_ being the first that springs to mind, the majority are down right awful, even if they are themselves written and released with the artists tongues firmly lodged in their cheeks. So, with this is mind, what else was there to do for comedic rockers **We Are Scientists** but to compose and perform their own England World Cup song … despite us preparing to line up against their home country USA in the group stages of the tournament in South Africa. In true **We Are Scientists** style, it’s a hilarious, biting scorn at those who merely see the World Cup as an opportunity to increase profit margins, as well as a tribute to those who so blindly and loyally back their team despite the many shortcomings the players may have. So next weekend when England kick off against Group C counterparts USA, be sure to have this free download on constant repeat, as you utter those cursed but ever so hopeful words for the upteenth time, “Come on England!”.\n\n[Download Goal!
