  "body": "Have long made my admiration for **Oyinda’s** music pretty clear; her debut EP was a mix of smooth, intoxicating pop numbers, whilst the material released so far this year sees her pushing the boat out a little more.\n\n_Flatline_, her latest single, is a sleek, expertly produced gem, landing somewhere between the sultry pop of George Maple, and the dancefloor ready AlunaGeorge.
