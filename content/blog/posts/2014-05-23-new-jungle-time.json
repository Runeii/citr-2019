  "body": "**JUNGLE’s** self-titled debut album (out 14 July via XL Recordings) is shaping up rather nicely.\n\nHaving caught them twice at SXSW, seeing them at both ends of the spectrum, once disastrous (albeit perhaps partially due to technical / venue difficulties), and the second time witness them smash it out the park, their sure to prove a huge crowd favourite at festivals over the summer. New track, _Time_, lifted from the album, doesn’t veer far away from their tried and tested sound, yet they do it so bloody well, that it’s impossible not to love.
