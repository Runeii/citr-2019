  "date": "2014-10-14T19:13:33",
  "body": "We love Adult Jazz, and we think their debut album ‘Gist Is’ is one of the best releases of 2014.\n\nTherefore when we saw their new video go online, we didn’t even really need to watch it to know it would be at least equal to their previous superb output. Creating a monochromatic representation of the brilliant ‘Am Gone’, we follow the fate of a lone soul trapped in a stock working his way towards his freedom before reaching a rather unexpected conclusion. This video is as clever and surprising as Adult Jazz’s music, and for that reason we strongly advise you watch it.",
