The track, which was directed by Tyler, The Creator, who also features on the chorus, is closer to Earl’s earlier material than ‘Chum’. This is reflected in the differing styles of the videos, ‘Chum’ was black & white and introspective, while ‘Woah’ has a more playful primary-coloured trailer park aesthetic, with other Odd Future members making appearances,\n\nEarl Sweatshirt continues to display a phenomenal virtuosity, his bars drip class and he piles rhyme upon rhyme in that peerless flow of his. At the time of writing, there has been no release date mentioned for his album, _Doris,_ but, judging by the amount of new material coming out of his camp, it can’t be too long now.",
