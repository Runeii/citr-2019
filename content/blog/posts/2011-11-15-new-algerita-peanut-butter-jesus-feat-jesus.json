  "body": "As if his comeback wasn’t well documented enough, Israeli legend **Jesus** has guested on this debut track from London’s **Algerita**, adding a whole new meaning to the phrase ‘the resurrection’.\n\nBut in all seriousness, the title of this track would point to the song itself being horrendous, however it’s a true testament to the cliche ‘don’t judge a book by it’s cover’. Predominantly ska influenced, and maintaining a lo-fi swagger, _Peanut Butter Jesus_ is a hugely successful first outing. By cementing itself as a folk inspired track, it prevents _Peanut Butter Jesus_ from becoming over-stretched and straying into the realms of tedious 80’s commercial ska-based music. Check out _Peanut Butter Jesus_ below.\n\n<a href=\"http://algerita.bandcamp.com/track/peanut-butter-jesus-feat-jesus\">Peanut Butter Jesus (feat. Jesus) by algerita</a>",
