With his debut single proper _Dumbin’_ released last month, and a remix from **Diplo** on the way, 2012 is going to be another stellar year for SS.\n\n [Star Slinger – Moet & Reese](http://soundcloud.com/starslingeruk/star-slinger-moet-reese) by [Star Slinger](http://soundcloud.com/starslingeruk)",
