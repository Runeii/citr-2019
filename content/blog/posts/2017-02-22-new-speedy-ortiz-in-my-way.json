  "body": "**Speedy Ortiz** add further quality to the [Our First 100 Days](https://ourfirst100days.</p><p>bandcamp.com/album/our-first-100-days) campaign with their latest single _In My Way. _The Massechusetts group join the likes of PWR BTTM, Toro Y Moi, and Surfer Blood to help raise money for the charity’s that will be effected by the Trump presidency. In My Way takes a less aggressive approach compared to some of groups previous projects with Sadie Dupuis’ vocals softly intertwining with fuzz soaked guitars. The bands knack for playful and intricate song writing still shines through despite the hooks not necessarily being as gnarled with the chorus especially profiting from a warmer tone. Check it out below, and be sure to support the Our First 100 Days campaign.\n\n<a href=\"http://ourfirst100days.bandcamp.com/album/our-first-100-days\">Our First 100 Days by Speedy Ortiz</a>",
