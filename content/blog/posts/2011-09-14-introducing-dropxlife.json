  "body": "Those that follow the Toronto collective **[XO](http://the-weeknd-xo.com/)** closely will no doubt have heard of **[DropXLife](http://www.youtube.com/user/dropxlife)**, a member of the mysterious group who’s been receiving a notable level of hype recently. The first dose of his work was originally presented as an unofficial Mixtape named **_‘Pawncho’_**. Since then the jams have been repackaged, 3 tracks have been added and the set has been renamed **_‘AllXLegends’_**. The tracks themselves have a remarkable similarity to the work of **[The Weeknd](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/10287-new-the-weeknd-thursday/ \"New: The Weeknd – Thursday\")**; yet still manage to offer something different entirely. The set of 9 instrumentals are slow, sexy and seductive, with subtle and gentle introductions of bass offering a seedy underbelly to the glistening and pristine productions.\n\nApart from the Mixtape and the fact that **DropXLife** is part of the **XO** collective, very little else is known about the man/woman. It’s likely this will continue, but when it comes to **XO**, that’s half the fun.\n\nStream the original **_Pawncho_** Mixtape below and download the completed **_AllXLegends_** Mixtape [**here.**  \n](http://www.sendspace.com/file/qexoff)",
