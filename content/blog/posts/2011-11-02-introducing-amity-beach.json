  "body": "Ontario five piece **Amity Beach** make joyous indie pop music destined to soundtrack gloriously messy parties around the world.\n\nThese are songs longing to be shouted back at the stereo, with a cold beer in one hand and that cute girl from math class tugging fervently on your wrist and heartstrings. _Jake’s Version Of Paradise_ has to be the most ludicrously upbeat track of the year, one part **Weezer**, one part sugary sweet candyfloss. Oh, and did I mention, it has trumpets?!\n\n**Amity Beach** are at their best when they just let it flow, such as on _You’ll Never Hear That Sound_, with it’s epic-pop roots, with lead singer **Geoff Ballie** proclaiming ‘_all of the Pharaoh’s (?) that drowned in the river are waking up_‘ with such delight that it’s impossible not to crack a smile.\n\nCheck out _Jake’s Version Of Paradise_ below, and head over to their [bandcamp](http://amitybeach.bandcamp.com/) to hear the rest of their self-titled debut EP.",
