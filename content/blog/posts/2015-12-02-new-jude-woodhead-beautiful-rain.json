  "date": "2015-12-02T16:36:17",
  "body": "Hailing from South London, Jude Woodhead has emerged with his striking debut effort ‘Beautiful Rain’.\n\n18 years old, classically trained on the trumpet and self taught on piano and drums, Woodhead has been working on music for several years prior to his debut offering. Inspired by Congolese and South African records found in his dad’s record collection, Woodhead has managed to blend these influences with the modern production styles of the likes of Four Tet and Floating Points.\n\n‘Beautiful Rain’ has a brilliant simplicity that galvanizes a vibrant and colourful energy that exists throughout the track. Working around a series of strong percussive beats, the nuances in the production and the distribution of sounds allows for a different experience on every listen.",
