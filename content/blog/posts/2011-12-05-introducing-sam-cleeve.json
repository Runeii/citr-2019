  "body": "With December well and truly underway, it seems slightly bizarre to still be ‘Introducing’ artists, yet I’m not too keen on the strict yearly based format that many people within the music industry work by.\n\nWho cares when music is created, providing it’s worth writing about, the release date shouldn’t make too much of a difference. I’ve been sitting on these tracks from Reading producer **Sam Cleeve** for a couple of weeks now, trying to work out how to convert the beauteous simplicity of his music into logical and insightful scripture.\n\nRelying heavily upon repeated piano sections, **Cleeve** conjures up stunning soundscapes, aided greatly by his impeccable production. The sumptuous _Metropolis_ swirls majestically before slipping effortlessly into the epic _Halogen_, combining classical inspirations with drone and ambient tendencies. It’s also refreshing to see **Sam Cleeve** taking an innovative approach with the release, packing each CD in a recycled sleeve with handwritten notes, tracklisting and a unique photo taken from the 1940s/50. Check out a couple of choice picks tomorrow, and head over to **Sam Cleeve’s** [bandcamp](http://samcleeve.bandcamp.com/) to grab the full release of _**Foundation Studies**_.",
