  "body": "I don’t really ‘get’ **Miike Snow**; they feel slightly behind their time in many senses, and have little that helps them standout from what is an extremely claustrophobic genre.\n\nTheir self-titled debut album sailed somewhat over my head, yet clearly caused a stir amongst many others, enough so that the group decided to go it alone for their sophomore album and release via their own record label, **INGRID**.\n\nEarlier this evening Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe premiered _Paddling Out_, the first single proper to be taken from their upcoming second album _**Happy To You**_. It’s not much of a departure in sound, sticking to their tried and tested electropop meets dance formula. Will it be remembered in 20 years time? Probably not. Does it matter? Not really.\n\nStream _Paddling Out_ below. Their sophomore record _**Happy To You**_ will be released on 26 March 2012.\n\n [Miike Snow – Paddling Out](http://soundcloud.com/miikesnow/miike-snow-paddling-out) by [miikesnow](http://soundcloud.com/miikesnow)",
