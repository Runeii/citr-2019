  "body": "Side-projects are notoriously inconsistent.\n\nSure, talented musicians shouldn’t just be limited to one river of creative output, but there’s a fine line between self-indulgent and undeniably worthwhile. Thankfully in the case of **Pretty Sister**, the project of **Brent Harris** from Auckland four piece [Cut Off Your Hands](http://www.facebook.com/cutoffyourhands?sk=info), this debut track is more than enough to justify recording under another moniker.\n\nHaving played _Oceans_ several times in the past hour, I’m still raking my brain for who it reminds me of. There’s elements of **The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart** in the guitar lines, whilst the unashamed indie-pop tendencies are **Lightning Seeds**\\-esque in nature, making for a wonderful first outing. Stream _Oceans_ below, and keep in touch with **Pretty Sister** via their [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Pretty-Sister/318136741542434?sk=wall).\n\n<a href=\"http://prettysister.bandcamp.com/album/oceans\">Oceans by Pretty Sister</a>",
