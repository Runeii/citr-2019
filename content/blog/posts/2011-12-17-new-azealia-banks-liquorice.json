  "body": "She’s done it again! After showing she knows her stuff with a **Machinedrum** collab, now she’s spat all over an original **Lone** production – his beautiful rave banger _Pineapple Crush_.\n\n**Lone** is possibly my favourite UK producer – his blissful style positively killing any memory of ‘other electronic music’ for me when I listen to him. **Azealia** **Banks** has great taste. She also shows why she’s not just another Kid Sister/Amanda Blank/Rye-Rye, and could perhaps be the new Fresh Prince(ss)? She can certainly keep a flow going like the aforementioned ex-high-faded ex-party-rapper. ‘Cept she’s ruder, and more contemporary; she’s down to earth. So nothing like Will Smith then…\n\nForgive that awful analogy. More to the point, I can’t wait to hear her debut, despite **Paul Epworth** being quite a straightforward choice to produce her album. But I’m sure you’re all as excited as I am, especially after hearing this joint.\n\n_Listen to Liquorice below._",
