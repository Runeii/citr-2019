  "body": "Whilst some of the early **BANKS** tracks felt a little passive and apathetic at times, her more recent run of material (_Goddess_ & _Brain_ in particular) are far more direct and forceful, going straight for the jugular, especially in the cutting lyrical content.\n\nWith her debut LP, Goddess, out in under two months time, she’s gradually teasing the entire album on her Soundcloud, with another track, _Beggin For Thread_, released this evening. More upbeat and memorable than the likes of _Bedroom Wall_ or _Fall Over_, it’s a side to BANKS that personally I far prefer.",
