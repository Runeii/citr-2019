Over the past few hours, Romantic Streams by Sleep ∞ Over has done just that, with it’s addictive chillwave hook and lo-fi aesthetic, proving both immeasurably stunning and devastatingly heartwrenching. Having already impressed at the recent Gorilla vs. Bear Fest, with a live line up featuring two members of Silent Diane and Jesse Jenkins from Pure X, **Stefanie Franciotti** is setting the bar high for Sleep ∞ Over on her debut LP Forever, out later this year. Romantic Streams is a fitting introduction to Franciotti’s music, mixing lush pop melodies with echoed, vaguely haunted synths. Forever is out on [Hippos in Tanks](http://hipposintanks.net/) on September 27, download Romantic Streams below.\n\n[Sleep ∞ Over – Romantic Streams](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/02-Romantic-Streams.mp3)\n\n [Romantic Streams](http://soundcloud.com/sleep-over/romantic-streams) by [Sleep ∞ Over](http://soundcloud.com/sleep-over)",
