  "body": "Heard this a couple of evenings back at the end of a particularly long day, and it just really struck a chord with me.\n\nThat sense of longing and confusion that so often seeps in when tired resonates deeply throughout _A Place To Drown_, the latest track from Liverpool’s **John Joseph Brill**. Elements of Keaton Henson and Kubb (remember them?!) drift in and out, yet the track manages to embody a character entirely it’s own. Check it out below.",
