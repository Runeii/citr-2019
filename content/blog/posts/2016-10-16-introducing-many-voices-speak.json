  "body": "Swedish singer **Many Voices Speak** (Matida Mård) channels some seriously elegant Beach House vibes on her debut single, _Video Child_.\n\nTender yet delicately reassured, there’s a gloriously carefree edge to her sound, that feels so blissfully honest. Having followed up Video Child with a beautiful cover of one of the classic ballads, Richard Rodgers’ Blue Moon and with an EP release just round the corner, Many Voices Speak is already making quite the impression. Check out both tracks below.\n\nFollow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
