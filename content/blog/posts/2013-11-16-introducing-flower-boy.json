  "body": "Having taken their first steps with a demo of their debut track, _Lemonade_, about five months ago, LA trio **Flower Boy** have returned with a revamped version of the track, with far cleaner, crisper production.\n\nComprised of Ryan Wemmer (drums), Brynn Herrick (bass, synth) and Kaitlynn Lucas (guitar, vocals), there’s no doubting where the immediate strength lies in **Flower Boy**; as soon as Lucas’s vocal hits, you’ll be completely smitten. At times, sounding like Lana Del Rey fronting Beach House, the potential shown on Lemonade makes it one of the most exciting debut tracks of the year.",
