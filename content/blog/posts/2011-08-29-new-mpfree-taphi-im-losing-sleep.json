  "body": "California’s music scene receives it’s fair share of praise, albeit at times undeservingly so, yet with this new track from Costa Mesa songstress [**Taphi**](http://www.facebook.com/taphitaphi), there’s plenty of reason to celebrate her work. There’s hints of **Laura Marling** and **Sarah Jaffe** in the delicately delivered vocals; two artists whom have numerous imitators but few who have perfected the art of sensual songwriting that originally made their inspirations so successful. _I’m Losing Sleep_ finds **Taphi** weeping _‘I don’t know why you left my lips dry’_ in a manner so graceful that it’s impossible to feel nothing for her plight and her tender words. Stream and download _I’m Losing Sleep_ below.",
