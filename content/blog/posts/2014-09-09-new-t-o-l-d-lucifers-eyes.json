Whilst appearing all sandy beaches and smiles on first listen, further plays reveal a darker, more sinister side to Lucifer’s Eyes, despite it’s initial pop sensibilities. Combining elements of Hurts with the groovier side of recent synth pop successes (St. Lucia, Panama Wedding etc.), it’s a debut that’s sure to garner plenty of attention.
