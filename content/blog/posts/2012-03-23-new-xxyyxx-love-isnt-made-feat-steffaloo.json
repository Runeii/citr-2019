  "date": "2012-03-23T15:51:07",
  "body": "**Marcel Everett** aka **xxyyxx** is blowing up at the moment, there’s no doubting that.\n\nWith a collaboration with **Giraffage** and **REID** on it’s way, it’s clear that 2012 is going to be his year. This new cut featuring the ever splendid vocals of **Steph Thompson**, otherwise known as **Steffaloo** sees **Everett** upping his game with a minimal, repetitive beat underpinned by the delicate, sparsely sampled vocals. If we ever needed confirmation of just how far both these artists have come in such a short space of time, then _Love Isn’t Made_ may well just be it.",
