  "body": "[**Main Attrakionz**’](https://www.facebook.com/mainattrakionz) album _Bossalinis & Fooliyones_ is just around the corner, the 23rd of October to be exact, and the tracks the record will sport are sounding increasingly impressive. Cloud Body is as much a celebration of Cloud Rap than anything else, but it does it with such passion and honesty it gets away with it in spades. This might not be the future of Hip-Hop just yet, but Main Attrakionz certainly think it is.",
