  "date": "2012-10-31T18:19:38",
  "body": "Having been holed up in bed with an awful stomach bug for the best part of 72 hours, the soothing sounds of Dutch producer _Lemontrip_ is exactly what I need to put me on the road to recovery.\n\nSlightly psychotic, atmospheric electronica, there’s touches of **Four Tet** and **Aphex Twin** amidst the gloomy samples and dare I say it, techno inspired soundscapes that the young producer conjures up. His debut LP **_Nowhere_** is a gorgeously intoxicating collection of instrumental lullabies; manipulating and toying with sounds to engrossing effect. Check out the full release below.",
