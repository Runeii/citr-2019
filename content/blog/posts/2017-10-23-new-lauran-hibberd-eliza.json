  "body": "Lauran Hibberd’s songwriting has a real sense of personality and character to it – a trait that’s increasingly rare in a passively playlist orientated world.\n\nWith a string of promising releases over the course of the past year, her most recent single, Eliza, is potentially her most confident yet. Slightly-saccharine but not cheesy indie-pop done really well, expect to hear this on a TV advert at some stage in the near future. Check it out below.",
