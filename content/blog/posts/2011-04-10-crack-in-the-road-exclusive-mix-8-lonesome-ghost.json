Their music ranges from the wonderfully carefree to the painfully provoking, what binds the music however, is its firm narrative drive. “I left my shoes at your parents’ house” exclaims _Matt_ on _Golden Cage_, **Lonesome Ghost** is a band that openly invites you into their world.\n\nMatt from the band recently threw together a mix for us; the tracks giving a rather fascinating look at his influences. Ranging from Beach Fossils to the dark and brooding Zoo Kid (your welcome Matt), the mix is a wonderful compilation of contemporary pop.  Give it a listen bellow.\n\n[Crack In The Road Exclusive Mix #8: Lonesome Ghost](http://www.mixcloud.com/crackintheroad/crack-in-the-road-exclusive-mix-8-lonesome-ghost/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=cloudcast_link) by [Crackintheroad](http://www.mixcloud.com/crackintheroad/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=profile_link) on [Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=base_links&utm_term=homepage_link)\n\n<a href=\"http://lonesomeghost.bandcamp.com/album/none-of-these-songs-are-about-you-or-anyone-you-know\">None of These Songs are About You or Anyone You Know by Lonesome Ghost</a>",
