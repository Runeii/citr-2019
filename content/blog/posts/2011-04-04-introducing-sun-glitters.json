At first glance he’s an artist riding the well ridden ‘chill-wave’. His synths are dreamy and ethereal, with the voice samples pitch tuned to create a ghost like atmosphere. Thankfully there’s so much more to **Sun Glitters**, his production is expertly crafted to form something that has a remarkable density. The voices whisper, giggle and mutter over the wonky hip-hip infused beats, in a way that simply isn’t present in most beat music today. The result is something genuinely enchanting.\n\n_Check out his Everything Could be Fine EP bellow._\n\n<a href=\"http://sunglitters.bandcamp.com/album/everything-could-be-fine\">everything could be fine by Sun Glitters</a>",
