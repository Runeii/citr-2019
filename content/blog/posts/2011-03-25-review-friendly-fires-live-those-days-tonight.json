Trailing the album release is their comeback single “Live Those Days Tonight” and it is a beauty of a record to return with.\n\nEschewing the po-faced seriousness that blights many bands comebacks after a hugely successful debut. “Live Those days..” is a continuation of the bright, club influenced pop that characterized their debut. A hook filled paean to club culture, going out and living for the moment it brims with excitement and vibrancy.\n\nAll manner of sounds and instruments create a heady cocktail of peerless dance pop which is highly percussive and, more importantly, highly danceable. Friendly Fires are the sound of summer 2011, expect to hear this everywhere.\n\n [Friendly Fires – Live Those Days Tonight](http://soundcloud.com/listenbeforeyoubuy/friendly-fires-live-those-days) by [ListenBeforeYouBuy](http://soundcloud.com/listenbeforeyoubuy)",
