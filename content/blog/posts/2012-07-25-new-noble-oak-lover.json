  "body": "**Noble Oak** is rapidly becoming one of the artists of the year, with a string of excellent releases under his belt, all that’s left for the young Canadian is a full length LP.\n\nNew track _Lover_ features the closest Pat has to a ‘radio-friendly’ chorus, eloquent and glistening with beauty. With each and every track **Noble Oak** releases, not only is his abundance of talent becoming more evident, but also his love for what he does – _“our love has gone away but i won’t stray no, follow me back home”._",
