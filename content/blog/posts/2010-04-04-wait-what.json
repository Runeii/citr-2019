Being a huge fan of Biggie, but not so much of The XX, I was unsure as what to make of this, as I felt the beats in many of Biggie’s songs were one of his strongest points. However, the chilled, laid back electronic sounds of The XX actually perfectly compliment the vocals of the deceased rapper. Standout track is undoubtedly Juicy-r, a mix of Notorious’s hit single Juicy and The XX’s album track VCR. Whilst I have to say I enjoyed this album more than that of The XX, I found it hard to see past the genius of Notorious B.I.G., and the first album I played after this was 1994’s Ready To Die. The Notorious XX is worth checking out, especially as I suspect that many will have heard The XX, but may not be so familiar with Biggie’s material used on the album.\n\nThe Notorious XX is avaliable to download free from  \n[http://waitwhatmusic.com/files/notoriousxx.html](http://waitwhatmusic.com/files/notoriousxx.html)",
