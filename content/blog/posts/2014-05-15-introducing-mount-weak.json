  "body": "There are plenty of things in life which are deservedly brazen and are all the more fantastical for it, such as the Miley Cyrus show I witnessed last night, however there are also things in life that gain their strength in their subtlety.\n\nMount Weak is one of those things.\n\nThe project of Ruthie Zofia Skrytek, ‘Paradise Lost’ is an understated affair of haunting piano, whispering vocals and an engaging yet softening beat. If there is one criticism you could wager against Mount Weak, is that there are no huge shifts in dynamic between the tracks that have been presented. With that said, with each one taken in their own right it is difficult to not get lost within the serenity.",
