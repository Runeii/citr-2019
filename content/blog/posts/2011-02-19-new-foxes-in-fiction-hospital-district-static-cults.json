Composed of two tracks pieced together by Warren over the last five weeks during a period of illness, and recorded on a digital four track and computer.\n\n“I made these songs in an attempt to get back my energy, health and motivation back and to give something away to everyone who’s been there to support Foxes in Fiction over the past year, I owe everything to you guys!”\n\n“A-Side” Hospital District is an atmospheric instrumental piece, filled with ethereal drones, showcasing Foxes In Fiction’s diverse and entrancing sound. The soundscape created on Static Cults is just as graceful, with the track elegantly conjuring up a delicately haunting ambiance. Sampled vocals provide a sense of the natural, despite appearing spontaneous. These are two more fantastic tracks from what is rapidly becoming an eclectic catalogue of work from Foxes In Fiction.\n\nFeel free to download the release from the link below.\n\n[Download Hospital District / Static Cults](http://www.mediafire.com/?qc4szyfc11r4v70)",
