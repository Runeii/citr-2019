Lead single _Threat To Narrative_ is another odd-pop masterpiece, fusing the sort of lo-fi aesthetic beloved of Casiotone For The Painfully Alone, with the broader, more expansive sound of LCD Soundsystem. Slightly introvert, and tongue in cheek at times: “but you bought all of my love / on a $10 card minimum”, it’s a unique, and thrilling sound, that Welch really makes his own.",
