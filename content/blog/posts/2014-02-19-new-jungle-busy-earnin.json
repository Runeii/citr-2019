  "body": "**JUNGLE** were possibly my favourite new band to emerge from 2013, and with their signing to illustrious label XL Recordings now confirmed, it’s clear that the only way is up.\n\nInfectious hooks galore, and with an attitude to live performance that quite frankly puts most other artists to shame, they’re bold, innovative and deliriously fantastic. New single, _Busy Earnin’_ picks up where the Chess Club Records EPs left off, with their 60’s soul meets early 90’s dance vibes. If there’s been a more downright enjoyable single released this year, then I’m yet to hear it.",
