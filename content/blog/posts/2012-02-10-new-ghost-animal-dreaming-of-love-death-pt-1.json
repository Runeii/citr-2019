  "body": "**Ghost Animal** have been away for too long.\n\nNot only are they one of the cutest duo’s around, but their chemistry is second to none, and boy, does it show in their music. New track _Dreaming of Love & Death Pt 1_, premiered earlier this evening by our friends at [yvyvnyl](http://yvynyl.tumblr.com/post/17382299520/ghost-animal-dreaming-of-love-death-pt-1) is a stomping, scuzz driven number, unrelenting throughout it’s raucous four minutes. Imagine **The Horrors** had grown up on **Sonic Youth** and you begin to understand the vibe of this new track; basically, it’s fucking awesome. Guys, never leave us again.",
