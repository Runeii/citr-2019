  "body": "Absolutely love this new song, _Swept Away_, from Chicago quartet **Star Tropics**, part of a double A-side single of sorts.\n\nSeemingly two years in the making, the group have only just cropped up on my radar, and listening through their Soundcloud, suggests a wealth of talent, and a real knack for penning perfectly composed Wild Nothing-esque pop songs. So despite the sickly sweet lyrics (these could be All American Rejects lyrics, right?), there’s something undoubtedly loveable about Swept Away, a testament to love soundtracked by music. Check out a couple of tracks below.",
