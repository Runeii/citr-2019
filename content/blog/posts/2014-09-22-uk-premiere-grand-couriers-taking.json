  "body": "Minneapolis duo **Grand Courriers** impressed on their woozy debut track Rejoice, combining the hazy, psychedelic vibes of Tame Impala with the sort of songwriting that wouldn’t look out of place on Frightened Rabbits’ The Midnight Organ Fight.\n\nTheir follow up outing, _Taking_, is yet again embedded with a certain amount of Hollywood Americana, and whilst they can’t give The Killers a run for their money yet, it may only be a matter of time. Taking is lifted from an EP out in November, check it out below.",
