  "body": "When I traveled over to Dublin in September last year for the fantastic **Hard Working Class Heroes Festival**, one act in particular blew me away.\n\nWith their unparalleled diversity and stunning vocal sections, **We Cut Corners** undoubtedly stole the show, and ensured that I’ve kept an eye on them ever since. Having released their debut album [**_Today I Realised I Could Go Home Backwards_**](http://www.wecutcorners.net/) a few months back, they’ve steadily been building up a loyal following, both in Ireland and over in the UK. New single _Toll Free_ is a joyous slice of **Foals** meets **The Maccabees** indie-pop, accompanied by an utterly bizarre yet quirky video directed by [TUSK](http://www.facebook.com/TuskProductions).",
