  "date": "2016-10-14T16:03:16",
  "body": "There’s such a glorious nostalgia to **Grace Lightman’s** music that comes across as so effortlessly elegant.\n\nHer latest offering, _Repair Repair_, yet again showcases her silky smooth vocal and her knack for penning addictive, slightly unorthodox but undoubtedly brilliant tracks. Perhaps her most outwardly ‘pop’ to date, there’s a real 70’s vibe to Repair Repair, almost feeling Kraftwerk influenced at points. Check it out below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
