  "body": "French outfit **Boys in Lilies** cropped up last year with their [debut EP](http://admin.</p><p>crackintheroad.com/music/22699-introducing-boys-in-lilies), Hatching EP1, a release that marked them out as a uniquely promising group, and their second part to their EP series follows up on much of the potential showcased on EP1. Glittering guitar lines, and featuring vocals from Laure Berneau, Marylou Mayniel, and Nastasia Paccagnini, it’s at times rather uncompromising, yet an almost otherworldly listen. Taking as much from early Björk releases as it seems to from modern, electronic-pop, EP highlight Handshake is a dense, foreboding number, as intriguing as it is beautiful.",
