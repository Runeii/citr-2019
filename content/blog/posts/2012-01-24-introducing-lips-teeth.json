  "body": "It took me a few listens to get my head around **Lips & Teeth**, most notably the stirringly anthemic _Kids These Days_.\n\nThe solo project of Denver musician **Nathan Meese**, it’s clear that these three debut tracks are as raw as they come, but they’re all the more enticing for it. The aforementioned _Kids These Days_ being the undoubted highlight, with it’s rousing build-up and strained vocals. Elsewhere there’s the pop inspired vulnerability of _Rainlake_, culminating in the rather wonderful lyric “_took a pill to feel the same, made a lake from falling rain_“. Comparison wise, it’s difficult to pick direct relations, with closest being the opening lines of _Kids These Days_ sounding scarily like Alex Turner. Check out _Kids These Days_ below.",
