  "body": "R.\n\nI.P. **The Strokes**. With their most recent release, **Comedown Machine**, it appears that the unity, talent and unbreakable friendships that made them such an exciting group in the early-mid-00’s, has completely disappeared. Now, without wanting to downplay the quality of this new jam from Knoxville’s **Nomadic Firs** aka **Ryan Boos**, there’s more than a hint of the New York rockers to it, yet infused with his own unique, upbeat brand of pop, that brought him so much attention on the blog-classic Vines. _Lavish Hush_ is less slick chillwave, more of a gritty, heartfelt, rush to the head, with Boos utilizing a gravely New York City Cops-style delivery; it’s a track that almost feels like it could have been tagged on the end of _**Is This It**_, and that’s by no means a bad thing.",
