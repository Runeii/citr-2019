  "body": "Following **Anthony Naples**’ debut EP, _Mad Disrespect_, the young New York base producer has been flying pretty high, traveling around Europe and even finding time to remix the **Four Tet** track _128 harps_.\n\nHis new EP, _EI Portal_, is a progression yet not a complete detachment from his previous effort. Full of dusty claps and thick and jaded wastelands, the record has a sleazy grove throughout that makes for something rather distinct if not altogether emotionally engaging.\n\nThe EP drops via The Trilogy Tapes this March.",
