Anyway, I hardly care that I’ve lost count of the number of times this track has been released, it’s still one of the best songs of recent years. With two hyped shows at Glastonbury, and the release of their debut album  just round the corner, **The 1975** are the UK’s most talked about band, and quite rightly so. _Sex_, the most recent track to be taken from their long awaited first LP, comes in re-recorded form, with the driving guitars and booming drum beat as epic as ever. Check it out below.",
