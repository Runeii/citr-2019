  "body": "**_Jupiter or Mars_**, by the phrases’ very definition, expresses notions of uncertainty amongst a sea of aspiration.\n\nPerhaps this is why the track feels so very human? It sports a certain degree of the crotch grabbing that features in so much of mainstream modern hip-hip, yet it’s also plagued with self doubt; which planet should I fly to/fuck it should I even fly there at all.\n\nUnderneath it all is a love story, and a lonely one at that, “**_contemplating flying back home cos’ I miss her_**”. The track really makes you question if what you’re doing right now is in anyway important, when you could be just making love.\n\nUnexpectedly moving.\n\n [Jupiter or Mars (Prod. by Handbook)](http://soundcloud.com/thatkidvenom/jupiter-or-mars-prod-by) by [VenoM](http://soundcloud.com/thatkidvenom)\n\nCheck out more tracks from **[VenoM](http://www.facebook.com/TeamVenoM11?sk=wall) [here.](http://soundcloud.com/thatkidvenom)**",
