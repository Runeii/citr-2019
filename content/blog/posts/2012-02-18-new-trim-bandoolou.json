  "body": "Now I don’t know about you, but it’s been a long time since I sat through a grime record from start to finish.\n\nIn fact, the last time I achieved this was probably after **[Trim](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Trim/88992465763)** dropped his debut Mixtape. Long story short, **Trim** has an effect on me.\n\nHe does everything right, great beats, sharp flows and just the right amount of abstract tendencies. The tape is made up of 10 tracks, 2 of which are actually freestyles, but frankly if it wasn’t in the tracks’ infro, you’d be hard pushed to notice. Grab the full tape [here](http://t.co/tbSSJyfM), and hit play below for a taste of the tape.\n\n**Tracklisting:**  \n1\\. Intro (Prod. Harmonic 313)  \n2\\. No For an Answer (Prod. Rude Kid)  \n3\\. Hate Me Feat. Obese, Nico Lindsay & Careless (Prod. Shotz)  \n4\\. Dat (Prod. Teddy)  \n5\\. Trim & Nico Lindsay Freestyle  \n6\\. Lord of Lords Feat. Riko (Prod. Harmonic 313)  \n7\\. War Mode Feat. Scorcher  \n8\\. Bandoolou Feat. Obese, Nico Lindsay & Careless (Prod. Shotz)  \n9\\. Motto Freestyle  \n10\\. Bar So Hard (Prod. Balistiq)",
