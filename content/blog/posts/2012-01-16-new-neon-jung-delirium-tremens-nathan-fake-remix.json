  "title": "New: Neon Jung – Delirium Tremens (Nathan Fake Remix)",
  "date": "2012-01-16T22:06:27",
  "body": "This year will be a big year for Nottingham’s **Lone**, I trust.\n\nHis label **Magic Wire** has previously released a promising single from his colleague **Neon Jung** – a friend I presume, previously known as **Keaver & Brause** and one time working with **Lone** as **Kona Triangle**. All projects I’ve mentioned are worth checking out if you haven’t already.\n\nAnyway, **Lone** mentioned a release of both his next album (entitled _Galaxy Garden_) and **Neon Jung**‘s next single, featuring a remix from **James Holden**‘s** Border Community** regular **Nathan Fake**. I assume the single’s coming soon because the remix has just been posted by Fake, and it’s brilliant – a long one, usual for the Norfolk producer, but also returning to previous greatness (2009’s _Hard Islands_ was his career highlight so far), and leapfrogging off last years **Radiohead** remix success. Plenty of ambience and a solid techno beat makes this one another surefire winner. It just needs to be heard to be believed…\n\n_Enjoy Nathan Fake’s remix of Delirium Tremens below_. _The single is out mid-February on 12″ via Magic Wire Recordings._",
