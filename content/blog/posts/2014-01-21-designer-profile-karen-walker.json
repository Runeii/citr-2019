Give it 15+ years and I can definitely see Tyler, Claudia, Elise and Alice-Rose forming a new ultra-hip Primrose Hill set, based in some currently off-the-radar pocket of Zone 2, stepping out with the likes of [Suri Cruise](http://suricruisefashion.blogspot.co.uk/) and [Apple and Moses Martin](http://blogs.babble.com/famecrawler/files/2010/04/INFphoto_1239908.jpg).\n\nFor more insight into the collection and campaign, go to [http://www.karenwalkereyewear.com/](http://www.karenwalkereyewear.com/) where you can read interviews with these super-trendy tykes. There are some real gems in there.\n\n[![Karen 6](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Karen-61.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Karen-61.jpg)\n\n_![Karen 5](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Karen-51.jpg)_",
