Vibrant and brilliantly over the top, it’s one of my favourite debut outings of the year, and ear marks I.AM.L as one to watch for the future. It’s the sort of track I imagine Ellie Goulding might have come up with had she been raised on Björk, Bat For Lashes and Lykke Li. **I.AM.L** is Brighton’s **Laura May**, check out her debut track below.",
