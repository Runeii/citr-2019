  "body": "Everything **Bullion** touches turns into a treat.\n\nWith the release of the debut **Vondelpark** LP, _Seabed_, just under a month away, this remix of album track _California Analog Dream_, is just what I needed to increase my excitement further. Taking what could loosely be described as a ballad, **Bullion** adds some thick grooves and some playful sampling of the original work to create something that slowly brings people to the dance floor, while keeping the more sombre elements of the original track intact. Keeping what’s great about the original, while pushing the whole thing in a distinctly new direction. Folks, that’s how you bloody remix.",
