  "body": "Icelandic composer _Olafur Arnalds_ isn’t afraid of going dark and melancholic, as shown on this new track _This Place Was A Shelter_, taken from his forthcoming album _**For Now I Am Winter**_ (out 25 February via Mercury Classics).\n\nSomewhat of a departure from the more organic, natural sound that he made his name for, it’s his ability to swing from the menacing to the enlightening, the enthusiastic to the hopeless. Check out _This Place Was A Shelter_ below, premiered via [DiS](http://drownedinsound.com/news/4145947-listen--olafur-arnalds-premieres-the-gorgeous-new-track-this-place-was-a-shelter).",
