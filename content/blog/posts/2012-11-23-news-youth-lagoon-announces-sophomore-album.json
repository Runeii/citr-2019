  "body": "**[Youth Lagoon](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/11492-review-youth-lagoon-the-year-of-hibernation/ \"Review: Youth Lagoon – The Year Of Hibernation\")’**s _The Year Of Hibernation_ was arguably one of the most beautiful indie-pop LP’s of 2011. It aggressively, all be it at times predictably, signed off the ‘rise of the bedroom musician’ memo for major labels all around the world, it was time for them to think about catching up. Kids with under £1000 worth of kit were making music they could never dream of putting out, and people were listening, and they still are.\n\nTrevor Powers, aka **Youth** **Lagoon**, had a thanksgiving surprise for us yesterday as he announced that his sophomore LP was finished and for all intents and purposes, ready to go. The album will be released sometime in 2013. We’re excited, you should be too.\n\n> so happy to say my new record is finished,can’t wait for u all to hear it.happy thanksgiving <3\n> \n> — Trevor Powers (@youthlagoon) [November 23, 2012](https://twitter.com/youthlagoon/status/271858210607079424)\n\nListen to _The Year Of Hibernation_ in its entirety below and get stoked for the new record.",
