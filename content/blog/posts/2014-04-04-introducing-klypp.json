  "body": "India is rapidly becoming a hot spot for electronic music, and Bangalore duo Faheem and Karthik Basker aka **Klypp** are one of the standout acts right now.\n\nTheir debut four track EP **_Manifest_** is a woozy mixture of Washed Out reverb-sodden vocals and glitchy James Blake meets Jai Paul beats. Lead track, _Be_, is one of the most perfectly composed tracks of the year, chillingly romantic yet somehow alluringly danceable.",
