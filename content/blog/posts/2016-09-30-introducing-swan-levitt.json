  "body": "The most harrowing, distressing circumstances can often lead to the birth of the most graceful, inspirational pieces of music.\n\nHailing from the Isle of Wight, **Swan Levitt’s** soulful, impassioned vocal on his debut track, _Alive,_ embodies a pain greater than the strength of the songwriting alone would divulge. Penned about a close friend suffering from cystic fibrosis who passed away last year, it’s poignantly momentous for a career so early in flight. Check out Alive below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
