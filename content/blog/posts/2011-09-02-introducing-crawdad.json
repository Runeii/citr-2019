  "body": "**Michael Crawford** otherwise known as **Crawdad**, a hip hop enthusiast from California may not necessarily be the complete article yet, however recent free download release _**The Art Of Making Flowetry**_ certainly demonstrates a vast wedge of potential.\n\nMixing modern production methods with **Doomtree** influenced verses, the EP is slick and fantastically mixed; quite an achievement for an artist without substantial label funding. Like **P.O.S.**, the instrumentation appears to be fairly heavily **Fugazi** inspired, raw and perfectly synched in to the languidly delivered vocals.\n\nWhilst the title _**The Art Of Making Flowetry**_ may not be entirely convincing, the tracks speak for themselves, offering up a fresh and invigorating sound. EP highlight _Broken Circuits_ wouldn’t be out of place on a **Doomtree** sampler, complete with charismatic verses and a enviable chorus. There’s an air of intelligence found in the lyrics as well, that are at times, insightful and thought-provoking, maintaining an emotional integrity and self-realism such as _‘the fact is that I put nothing above you, it hurts my heart at times to say I love you’_ on _Riddle My Mind_. The **De La Sou**l-esque _They Don’t Know_ mixes soulful vibes with the harsh vocal sections that **Crawdad** stamps throughout the release. As mentioned earlier, **Crawdad** is far from the finished product, but with music driven by such a passion and wealth of knowledge, _**The Art Of Making Flowetry**_ gives numerous reasons to be truly excited about **Michael Crawford’s** work.\n\nCheck out two cuts from the EP on this page, and head over to **Crawdad’s** [bandcamp](http://crawdad.bandcamp.com/) to download the entire release for free.",
