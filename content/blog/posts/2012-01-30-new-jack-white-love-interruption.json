  "body": "It’s something **Jack White** should have done years ago, but he’s finally got around to it.\n\nEverybody’s favourite magpie musician has been a very busy man – previous band projects (**The White Stripes**, **The Raconteurs**, **The Dead Weather**), producing (everyone from **Whirlwind Heat** to **John C Reilly**), messing around with collaborators (from **Beck** to**Insane Clown Posse**) and releasing live recordings (**White Denim**, **Jacuzzi Boys**,** Jeff The Brotherhood**) through his label **Third Man Records** – and is now ready to go solo.\n\nThe new album, _Blunderbuss_, will be out in April, and this is the first taste of that material. Warm, stripped back, but distinctly **White**‘s style. You know what you’re getting with this one. I hope this will be a nice little album, possibly taking note of his friend **Beck**‘s more acoustic country stuff, but with strong blues and folk elements. We’ll have to wait and see about the full album, but for now, enjoy this…\n\n_Hear Jack’s debut solo single, Love Interruption, below_. _Blunderbuss is due April 23rd on Third Man Records/XL Recordings_.",
