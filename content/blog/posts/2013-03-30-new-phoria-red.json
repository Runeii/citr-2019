  "body": "Not quite sure why I slept on this one.\n\nThe fact that most of my favourite new music blogs posted it earlier in the week suggests that I should have been on it far soon. **Phoria**, a group from Brighton comprised of Seryn Burden, Tim Douglas, Jeb Hardwick, Trewin Howard and Ed Sanderson, have created serious waves with their new track _Red_, an elegant homage to early ’00’s R&B. With utterly sublime vocals that float effortlessly between the layers of handclaps and film samples, it’s not too far from the ‘sadcore’ sound currently being pioneered by SOHN; yet with an added narrative element. Amidst the despair and desperation, there’s an underlying feelign that **Phoria** truly have a story to tell, and I’m more than eager to hear it. Check out _Red_ below.",
