  "date": "2015-02-11T17:30:36",
  "body": "Having already played shows with The Districts, Only Real and Wet, Manchester trio **Rains** have more experience than their limited social media presence would suggest, yet _Fed Up_ appears to be their debut offering.\n\nSo it’s not a polished, indie pop song, you’re unlikely to hear it in Topman, but there’s something ‘cool’ about it. It’s laidback and effortless in the same way that Mac DeMarco has made a career from being so, all whilst telling a story of self-improvement within love. Check it out below.\n\n<a href=\"http://rainsfordays.bandcamp.com/track/fed-up\">Fed Up by Rains</a>",
