  "body": "Really enjoyed London duo **GIANTS** and their two debut track, featuring YADi and Keith Murray, unfortunately their third offering, the Josef Salvat featuring [Throwback](https://soundcloud.</p><p>com/believeingiants/throwback-feat-josef-salvat), dropped just as I was in full on dissertation mode. Anyway, glad I caught their fourth track, this time calling in the recently [Neon Gold](http://neongoldrecords.com/wolffe-shoot-you-down/) featured Wølffe for an elegant pop masterclass.
