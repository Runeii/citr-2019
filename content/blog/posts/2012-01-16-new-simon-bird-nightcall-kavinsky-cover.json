  "body": "No, not [that](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Bird) **Simon Bird**; this Dublin based musician of the same name actually displays genuine talent, especially on this newest track of his. Covering **Kavinsky’s** _Nightcall_, made famous in ’11 by featuring on the soundtrack for **Nicolas Winding Refn’s** hit film **Drive**, it’s a unique and fitting take on what is an immensely difficult track. Thematically, it feels more precarious than the original, perhaps what **Gosling** would have listened to had he been tripping on acid. **Bird’s** cover features on _**Quompilation #2**_, out 27 January on [The Quarter Inch Collective](http://quarterinchcollective.wordpress.com/).\n\n [Simon Bird – Nightcall (Kavinsky Cover)](http://soundcloud.com/quarter-inch-collective/simon-bird-nightcall-kavinsky) by [Quarter Inch Collective](http://soundcloud.com/quarter-inch-collective)",
