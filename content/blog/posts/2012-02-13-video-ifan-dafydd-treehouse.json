Warranted or not, his new single, [‘**_Treehouse_**’](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/13466-new-ifan-dafydd-treehouseto-me/ \"New: Ifan Dafydd – Treehouse/To Me\"), is bold, complex and dizzying. The recording itself has been streaming on the net for a while now, but as of 2 days ago we were gifted with an official video for the track.\n\nOddly moving and surreal in its execution, the film projects feelings of social anxiety and isolation in both ambiguously intriguing and confidently visceral ways. It also features a big ass panda, what’s not to love?\n\nVia [Fact](http://www.factmag.com/2012/02/11/ifan-dafydd-treehouse/)",
