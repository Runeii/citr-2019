  "body": "**Sigrid** goes straight for the jugular on her official debut single, _Don’t Kill My Vibe_.\n\nWith a handful of live shows during the course of the last eighteen months which saw A&R’s flocking from all round the world to see her play, this first offering delivers on the promise of the early hype. There’s no quiet introduction, no gradual move toward mainstream success – this is an out and out pop hit in waiting, and the early Spotify stats tell a similar story, clocking up the best part of a million plays since it’s release on Friday – perhaps the most impressive figures I can remember for any new artist without a significant backstory. Check it out below.",
