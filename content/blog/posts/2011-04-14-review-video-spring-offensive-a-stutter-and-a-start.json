New single A Stutter and a Start is relatively understated when compared to their previous release, the fourteen minute epic that was The First Of Many Dreams About Monsters. However it’s still a cracking track; jagged guitars and somber, honest vocals make up A Stutter and A Start, which tells the story of a person in turmoil, with relationships, their well being and even their car. The video follows a simple thematical issue, a one take job showing the band helping out the protagonist with his every day chores, ranging from cleaning his teeth to stumbling home drunk from a night out.",
