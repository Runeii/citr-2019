His remix of the debut single from [**Vondelpark**’s](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/18687-video-vondelpark-dracula/ \"Video: Vondelpark – Dracula\") debut LP, _Seabed_, has been doing the rounds for a while now. Now we have a video, a stomach churning and rough and ready clusterfuck from the 90’s. It’s rather fitting, the remix is a damaged and at times ghostly reinterpretation of the original, the video is the same, the reasons for this however are far less clear.\n\n_Seabed_ drops in February via R&S.",
