This was largely down to the complete lack of material online. After watching them live last night however I was compelled to write about them regardless. The set was full of elegantly eerie visuals and a confident mixture of styles. Mixing elements of dubstep and witchhaus, **CREEP** on paper sound like a lot of bands doing the rounds at present, but it’s their attempt to embrace a more ambitious, orchestral like sound that’s making them stand out. This was even more evident when played live, they came complete with a superb cello player, who effortlessly gave the sound a clarity that no lo-fi spooky ass shit can come close to. Expect a full review of the show tomorrow.\n\n [CREEP / Days](http://soundcloud.com/youngturks/creep-days) by [Young Turks](http://soundcloud.com/youngturks)",
