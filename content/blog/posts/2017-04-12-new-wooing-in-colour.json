  "title": "New: Wooing – In Colour",
  "date": "2017-04-12T16:14:44",
  "body": "Wooing’s debut track _In Colour _is a bewildering and exciting psych rock anthem.\n\nThe band led by Rachel Trachtenburg of Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players and Supercute! fame begin the song with a very sparse almost melancholic dream pop intro before taking it up a serious gear. All of a sudden the rest of the band come in and Rachel’s echoed vocals hover in and around stern drum drums and a fierce distorted guitar that gives In Colour a real heavy bite. This is a fantastic introduction to Wooing with their EP DayDream Time Machine a must to look out for in May.",
