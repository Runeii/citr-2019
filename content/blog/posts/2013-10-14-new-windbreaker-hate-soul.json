  "body": "Having been raised on The Clash, The Adicts and Stiff Little Finger, Boston’s **Windbreaker** aka Darin Thompson, fits in perfectly with my 70’s punk tastes.\n\nA jagged guitar riff that isn’t too far from the likes of White Riot or Rock The Casbah, I Hate My Soul is the third track from Thompson, and continues the development of his emotionally unstable pop-punk that’s sure to seep under your skin. **Windbreaker** releases his debut EP **_Let It Go_** on 11 November through [Heart Throb Records](http://heartthrobrecords.bandcamp.com/album/let-it-go-ep)\n\nnow I know why  \nthat song you tried  \nto sing to death  \nwas relevant  \nit perched my soul  \nthe pitch seeped in  \nnow I should sleep  \nand make amends",
