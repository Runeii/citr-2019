  "body": "Having given these teenagers their first whiff of internet fame, I’m claiming any success that **Blaenavon** earn for myself.\n\n[Introducing](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/12867-introducing-blaenavon/) them well over a year ago, I’ve been eagerly expecting new material from the trio, and these two new tracks come along with the news that they’ll be releasing a 7″ via Paradyse Records, oh and a hilariously awkward promo picture. _Into The Night_ and _Denim Patches_ are two slices of invigorating post-Foals indie, amidst a world where **WU LYF** no longer play heavy pop and yet **Palma Violets** and **Peace** both still exist, it’s mightily refreshing to hear such an exciting young band. Pre-order the 7″ [here](http://paradyserecords.bigcartel.com/product/pre-order-blaenavon-into-the-night-denim-patches), or alternatively pick it up at your local HMV in March.",
