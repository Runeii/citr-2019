  "body": "The 23rd release on **Erik Hidde’s** **Housewarming Records** comes from New York producer **J Biscuits**, and it’s a refreshingly unique listen.\n\nWhilst many modern producers chose to remain entirely electronic, and shun what were previously perceived to be conventional methods, **J Biscuits** strength lies within his adaptation of the natural. Whether it be the solemnly haunting clarinet or the tribal-esque swing of _Spiced Rum_, **James Broughton** clearly understands the complexity yet benefit of keeping his music grounded.\n\nHis debut EP _**Quests**_ is a stimulating listen, flexing it’s inner beauty throughout it’s six track run length. It reminds me of driving down a street of high rise buildings, and catching glimpses of other paths of life down the various intersections that flash by, all too fleeting yet memorable. Stream my personal favourite, _Attacked By Panthers_ below, and head over to the **Housewarming Records** [bandcamp](http://housewarmingrecords.bandcamp.com/album/quests) for a full download.\n\n<a href=\"http://housewarmingrecords.bandcamp.com/track/attacked-by-panthers\">Attacked by Panthers by J Biscuits</a>",
