What I will say however, is that it’s been on repeat from the moment I heard it.\n\n_**Visions**_ drops on **02/21** via [4AD](http://4ad.com/) in the States and UK, and [Arbutus](http://www.arbutusrecords.com/) in Canada.\n\n[Grimes – Genesis](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Grimes_-_Genesis.mp3)",
