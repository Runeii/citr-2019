  "body": "So I’m having to make an assumption here, however I’m fairly sure that **EDDI FRONT** is the same sweet-voiced songstress as **EDDI LINES**, whom [debuted](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/16124-new-eddi-lines-gigantic/) on the CitR pages a little over two weeks ago. The tinkling piano and plaintive vocals are telling similar, and the general 60’s ballad feel to _CRY BELXIS_ gives it away, not to mention that that _LINES_ and _FRONT_ both hail from New York. Anyway, **EDDI**, if you’re reading this, please give us a little more information, oh and more of your sumptuous music.",
