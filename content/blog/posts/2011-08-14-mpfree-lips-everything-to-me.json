  "body": "The rise of bedroom producers in the last few years has been nigh-on unprecedented in so far as musical movements go.\n\nAn extravagantly priced studio is no longer a must in a budding musicians itinerary, also allowing for a greater range of styles and techniques to be adopted. New Zealand born **Steph Brown** aka **Lips** is a fine example of this, utilizing her modest Casio to flamboyant extent. New track _Everything To Me_ is available as a free download via the Lips [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/lipssongs?sk=app_216954765016828) page, and is an emotionally sumptuous blend of **Little Boots** and **Regina Spektor**. Much of the track’s atmosphere can be attributed to the spacious feel created, partially down to the simplistic beat and lavish violins that dominant the track. Stream the track below and head over to the **Lips** [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/lipssongs?sk=app_216954765016828) page for a free of download _Everything To Me_.\n\n[Everything to me](http://soundcloud.com/casiolips/everything-to-me) by [LIPS Songs](http://soundcloud.com/casiolips)",
