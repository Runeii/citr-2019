  "body": "For an artist I was so keen on last year, this new cut from **[BELL](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/10570-introducing-bell/ \"Introducing: BELL\")** had completely slipped my radar. The new track; part pop, part Rn’B and part synth pop, manages to be down right erratic while transiently soothing. It’s excitingly fragmented and seems to find interest in another idea almost as soon as it’s finished with the last one. But more than anything, it’s a damn good pop song; catchy as hell and a welcome return.",
