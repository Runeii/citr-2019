  "title": "New MPfree: Mirror Lady – Roman Candles",
  "date": "2012-01-23T00:07:52",
  "body": "Although probably not ‘new’ by International Internet Relevance Committee standards (may not actually exist yet), this track from Los Angeles trio **Mirror Lady** is certainly worthy of hearing.\n\nCombining folk-pop songwriting with lo-fi recording aesthetics, all topped off by rather unique vocals, _Roman Candles_ is a thoughtful slice of indie-pop. Lyrically it’s spot on as well; with “_and when your heart attacks, you’ll be screaming my name_” being a particularly poignant highlight. Check out _Roman Candles_ below, and download it for free if you fancy.",
