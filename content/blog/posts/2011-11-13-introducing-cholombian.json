  "body": "Turn off X-Factor, put your phone on silent and recall your finest pair of headphones, ‘cus **Cholombian** is taking you on a journey.\n\nHailing from Southampton, his ambient soundscapes are engrossing in a way that is rarely possible. On his new EP, entitled _**II**_, there’s a delicately moving knowledge of atmosphere that elevates it above the vast majority of instrumental producers, fusing piano chords, glitchy beats and reverbed samples to expert effect. _Bitter Ends_ draws the listener right to the edge, dangling them precariously before jolting them back into reality, flowing straight into the simplistically resplendent _Like Caged Animals_.\n\nTechnically, there’s no ground breaking musicianship, but it’s **Cholombian’s** ability to piece together his tracks in such a versatile way that allows this EP to succeed. A wash with drone based synths and lose hi-hats, you will find few listening experiences like it this year. There’s an underlying post-rock influence to his work, that prevents it from becoming stagnant and self-indulgent, leading the listener on a stimulatingly organic experience. Check out _Bitter Ends_ below, and head over to **Cholombian’s** [bandcamp](http://cholombian.bandcamp.com/) to grab the rest of the EP for free.",
