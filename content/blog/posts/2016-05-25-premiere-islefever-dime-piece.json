  "body": "This debut track from Echo Park’s **isle&fever** may well be one of the funkiest tracks I’ve heard this year.\n\nUnashamedly 70’s inspired; combining Chic influenced songwriting, with some of the slickest production around, _Dime Piece_ is a summer anthem in waiting, absolutely overflowing with feelgood vibes. With their debut EP out on vinyl later in the year, isle&fever are definitely an act to be keeping an eye on.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
