  "title": "Video: TEL AVIV – Thriller",
  "date": "2013-03-25T14:27:30",
  "body": "Pop culture references, attractive girls smoking seductively and an overarching sense of ambiguity, UK duo **TEL AVIV** know their potential market, and play right into it’s arms.\n\nSo it’s hardly a unique concept for a video, and their sound isn’t pushing boundaries, yet what they do, they do with utter perfection in mind. What really intrigues me about _Thriller_ is the slick, effervescent element to the track, verging upon classic 70’s glam-rock in style and mid-00’s euro-pop in precision, with the combination of both working effortlessly to form a poignant connection. Check out _Thriller_ below.",
