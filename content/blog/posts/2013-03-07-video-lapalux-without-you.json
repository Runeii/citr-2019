  "body": "We’ve been posting more and more work from Uk beat maker **Lapalux** in the lead up to his debut LP due out via **Brainfeeder**.\n\nThe producer is really coming into his own, with his pallet finally sounding composed and resolved. Album cut, _Without You_, now has a video, a stomach churning mournful story of a doomed relationship, thanks mostly to the fact that one of the pair is permanently dressed in a gimp suit. Rather than taking it off he chooses to star in this music video, which I can only assume is inspired by//is real events. He should just take it off.\n\nTaken from **Lapalux**‘s debut album ‘_Nostalchic_‘ – released 26 March worldwide on Brainfeeder.",
