  "date": "2014-08-07T16:22:04",
  "body": "Already one of the breakthrough acts of the year, and a name sure to be there or thereabouts in every tastemakers tips for 2015, **Jack Garratt’s** rapid rise to fame doesn’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon.\n\nThis latest remix comes courtesy of co-songwriter/producer **Goldfish** (Bastian Langebaek), who originally lent his talents to Garratt’s online smash, _Worry_. Keeping Jack’s pitch-perfect vocals, and layering them in amongst a kaleidoscope of fluctuating beats, not only is it a fantastic remix in its own right, it’s also perhaps a hint at the sort of direction Garratt himself could go in. Check out Goldfish’s remix of _Remnants_ below, and the original version of Worry.",
