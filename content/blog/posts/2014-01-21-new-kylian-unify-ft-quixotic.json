  "body": "**Unify** is a very promising new track from Brooklyn-based artist Emily Holden aka **Kylian**.\n\nThe track features Kansas City natives Quixotic Fusion, but the contribution isn’t immediately clear. The vocals are most certainly Emily, so I’m guessing the instrumentals are from Quixotic. Either way the collaboration works, giving birth to the purest kind of electronic music. Forgive the following cliché sentence, but these two seem to _unify _quite well. I’d love to hear the story about how they met and made this track as Kansas City is quite a ways away from good ol’ Brooklyn.\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/130700301″ params=”color=ff6600&auto\\_play=false&show\\_artwork=true” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]",
