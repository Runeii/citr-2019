  "body": "A track by LA’s **Kidä** cropped up on my radar a little while back, however when I went to post it, all traces of it had disappeared from the internet.\n\nHaving stumbled across it again a few days ago it seems reasonable to share it now; _Snakes_, a twisted, ambitious production, that despite existing within an ever crowded genre, manages to feel fresh and unique. Her latest offering, _Girls_, released a few days go, is more pop leaning but no less impressive, merging elements of R&B with glitchy, sparkling production. Check out both tracks below.",
