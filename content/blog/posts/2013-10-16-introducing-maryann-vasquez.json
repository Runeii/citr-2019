  "body": "LA’s **Maryann Vasquez** is getting better and better with every track she releases.\n\nWith a debut EP titled Due out 20 October, she’s dropped _Turn You Down_ on her Soundcloud, a straight up 90’s inspired R&B jam. Alongside _Turn You Down_, her Soundcloud also features a rather fantastic take on **Ellie Goulding’s** Burn, and two other originals, _Priscilla’s Song_, and her year old debut track, _Where The Wind Blows_. Check out a selection of her tracks below, and keep your ears peeled for Due, out in a few days.",
