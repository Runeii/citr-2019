  "title": "New: Little Deed – NEON",
  "date": "2014-07-24T16:58:00",
  "body": "For a song titled _NEON_, Sydney’s **Little Deeds** debut (somewhat of a relaunch in truth) track is rather more subdued than you’d expect; that’s not to say it’s not hugely impressive.\n\nElements of London Grammar’s Hannah Reid or Florence Welch drift in and out, yet there’s far more to Little Deed than simply a great voice, this is some dauntingly good songwriting. Building to a gloriously over the top crescendo, it’s safe to say that Little Deed has made on hell of an impression. Check out _NEON_ below ([via](http://indiemusicfilter.com/currently-listening-little-deed)).",
