  "body": "The solo project of Austrian native Philipp Szalay, **Farewell Dear Ghost** has been bubbling away under the surface for little under two years, perfecting his art and readying the release of his debut single _Cool Blood_, and it doesn’t disappoint.\n\nHaving played a smattering of live shows as a three piece (featuring Günther Paulitsch and Lukas Schneeberger), this single will surely open them up to a far wider audience. An epic, brooding affair, that’s as bold and dynamic as it is intimate; it’s a love song at heart and a wonderfully over the top introduction to **Farewell Dear Ghost**. Check out _Cool Blood_ below, and keep up with Szalay via [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/farewelldearghost).",
