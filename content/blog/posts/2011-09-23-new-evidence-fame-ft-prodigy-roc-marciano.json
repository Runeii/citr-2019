  "body": "The latest tune to leak from [**Evidence**’s](http://www.facebook.com/misterevidence) upcoming LP, entitled **_Cats & Dogs_**, is a classic case of judging a track not necessarily by what it’s saying, but rather how it’s saying it. The track featuring heavy hitters **Prodigy** & **Roc Marciano** might not blow boundaries to pieces, it’s boastful and ‘dealing with fame’ pretext certainly isn’t the most original of concepts. Regardless, the three MCs do it with such a smooth ability and bounce of each others flows with such venom, it’s hard not to be caught up in the track.\n\nCats & Dogs is released on September 27th.",
