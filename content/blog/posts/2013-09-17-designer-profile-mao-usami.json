  "body": "‘**Unisexy’**\n\nI asked my white T-shirt : “What is the fashion?”\n\n“What is the humor seriously?”\n\n“What is the sexuality?”\n\n“What, What, What….\n\nWhat?”\n\nYou never answered but I hope you are well.\n\nIt was a few months back now, but the moment when **Mao Usami** completely dominated the **Central Saint Martin’s BA Fashion Degree Show** earlier in the year is one I could quite happily relive again and again.\n\nThe womenswear designer combined a foisty, dishevelled P.E. kit aesthetic with impeccable attention to detail. Every gaping crotch, exposed undergarment and half-pulled-off hockey sock was as carefully constructed on the inside as it was on the outside.\n\nBut still, everything seems unfinished – or finished then unfinished again. It’s all about getting ready to go out, getting socks trapped in doors, feeling ugly, hating the pretense of it all, deciding you don’t really give a shit about looking nice anyway and being destructive to counteract the whole stupid ordeal. It’s teen angst and questioning sexuality. It’s rebellion. It’s Kevin and Perry Go Large.\n\n[![Usami red&blue](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Usami-redblue.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Usami-redblue.jpg) [![Usami catwalk](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Usami-catwalk.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Usami-catwalk.jpg)\n\nQuite frankly, I loved everything about it. I loved the layering and the slumped silhouettes. I loved the models of all shapes, sizes, ages and ethnicities. And I really, really love that her website features a photo of a middle-finger elephant poking out of a pair of pants.\n\nSee the elephant and more on Mao Usami’s website [here.](http://maousami.com/)",
