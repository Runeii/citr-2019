  "body": "Search the name **ATLAS** on Facebook and it’s like stepping back in time; you’re met with a host of mid-00’s **Blink-182** rock-pop bands, attempting to pedal their garage-recorded four track demo.\n\nWell fear not, for this cut from the UK’s very own **ATLAS** couldn’t be further removed from the muck and grime of sweaty lo-fi indie-pop. Whilst the first couple of minutes allude to _ATLAS_ being a slightly niche, female fronted folk outfit, it’s not until _You_ really kicks in that you feel the full force of the track. Obvious comparisons can be drawn to the likes of **Massive Attack** and **Portishead**, yet it’s the post-rock influence that intrigues me, with the tender sound of **Meanwhile, Back In Communist Russia** plastered all over _You_. Lose yourself.",
