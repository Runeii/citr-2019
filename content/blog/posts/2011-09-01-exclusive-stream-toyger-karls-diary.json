  "body": "North East music has seen some notable successes in the past 12 months, with **Let’s Buy Happiness** receiving critical praise from national press and **Polarsets** releasing a single through ultra-cool Parisian label **Kitsune**.\n\nHowever behind this buoyant wave of bands comes a new generation of artists benefiting from the increased attention and creative input that surrounds gigs and recording studios both sides of the Tyne.\n\nIt feels like a long time ago I first posted about **Toyger**, and made a crude reference to their stuffed toy counterparts, however they are a fine example of one of the bands to follow in the wake of North East’s latest crop of fine musicians. They are due to release their latest single ‘**Karl’s Diary**‘ on the 24th October, and the track, along with their B-side ‘**Purple Voices**‘, mark a significant development in the band’s sound, while retaining the core characteristics that first distinguished them.\n\n Karl’s Diary by [bencrackintheroad](http://soundcloud.com/bencrackintheroad)",
