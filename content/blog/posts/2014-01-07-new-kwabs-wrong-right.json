  "body": "With the **SOHN** produced _Last Stand_ tearing up the Hype Machine a couple of months back, Londoner **Kwabs** is back for on new cut Wrong or Right.\n\nLifted from his debut EP of the same name out later this year, Kwabena Adjepong recalls **SOHN** on production duties, mixing in some real late 90’s R&B vibes, with a touch of UK garage. Forget about your Sound of 2014 lists, Kwabs is all you need.",
