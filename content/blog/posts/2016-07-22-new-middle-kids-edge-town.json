  "body": "Another striking example of how the Australian music scene remains to be as vibrant and varied as it has been for the past few years, Middle Kids have emerged with their debut effort ‘Edge of Town’ as an instantly catchy gem.\n\nFormed by Hannah Joy and Tim Fitz following collaborations as solo artists, Middle Kids appear to be soaring in a vein of thumping indie rock. Joy’s vocals are immediately striking, and her lyrical melodies cannot fail to hold the attention of the listener.\n\nOn tour with Julia Jacklin in Australia after recently selling out a headline show, Middle Kids are certainly a one to watch.",
