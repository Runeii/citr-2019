Combining elements of shoe-gaze, hip-hop and chill wave it ultimately formed a reverberating synths laden delight. Its main strength was its want and need to experiment. No one tune clung to a particular theme or style, yet the record as a whole still managed to cling to a sound. In this case: thoughts of a damaged metropolis.\n\nDespite the genre jumping, each tune on the EP worked when compared to one another, in many ways they still do with his new record _KARAOKE_. The sound is still more focused but bizarrely loses the wonder that made his last EP a joy to listen to. The low-fi grooves are still interesting and Walsh can undoubtedly get your head bopping quicker and for longer than most, yet it all seems like a well-trodden formula.\n\n_Birthday Girl_ and _Dark Future_ are two tracks that embrace the free-form personality of the last EP but as obnoxious as it sounds, the rest of the record comes across as lo-fi Justice B-sides, leaving the EP feeling mundane.",
