  "body": "Made up of members from LA bands **One Trick Pony** and **The Transmissions**, **Bright Beast’s** couple of debut tracks embody such a unique, enthralling characteristic.\n\nSo their artwork and general presentation might be slightly questionable, there’s no doubting the quality shown on their self-titled EP. Driven by brooding bass lines and a steady percussion section, _(war paint)_ comes across like a more funky almost tribal inspired **Interpol** whilst _(camera)_ could easily pass for an early **TV on the Radio** single. Having played their premiere show in LA back in November, and with a EP expected later this month, I’m expecting big things from **Bright Beast**.\n\n<a href=\"http://brightbeast.bandcamp.com/album/bright-beast-ep\">Bright Beast EP by Bright Beast</a>",
