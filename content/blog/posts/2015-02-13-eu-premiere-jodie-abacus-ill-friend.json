  "date": "2015-02-13T13:08:23",
  "body": "This impressive debut from London’s **Jodie Abacu**s stands out as one of the feel good moments of the year thus far.\n\nPenned last year after having fought off pneumonia, _I’ll Be That Friend_ is an ode to eternal companionship – admirably honest without a hint of pretentiousness. With the Magical Mystery Tour-esque piano chords underpinned by Abacus’ uplifting, soulful vocal, it’s a million miles from anything else around right now, and all the more utterly brilliant for it. Check it out below, alongside details of his upcoming shows.",
