  "body": "There’s nothing like a Christmas meal with some of your closest friends to bring the sentimental side out in a boy, but the new cut from [Cascine’s](https://soundcloud.com/cascine) **[Wintercoats](https://soundcloud.com/wintercoatsmusic)** comes dangerously close. Admittedly, his debit EP, **_Sketches_**, had passed me by up until this point, but with music as somberly elegant as this new track, my ignorance surely won’t last for long. Sitting somewhere between the likes of **[Perfume Genius](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14957-stream-perfume-genius-put-your-back-n-2-it/ \"Stream: Perfume Genius – Put Your Back N 2 It\")** and **[Oupa](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/10147-review-oupa-forget/ \"Review: Oupa – Forget\")**, it has the remarkable energy of bitter sadness intertwined with unrivalled hopefulness. It heaves itself to the finish-line, admittedly this is just the ability to cope, but it does so with such elegance and beauty that he gets more than just our sympathy, he gets our support.\n\nDownload it for free below.\n\nvia [No Fear Of Pop](http://nofearofpop.com/)",
