  "body": "**Gawls**, aka Louie Peacock describes his own music in a rather humorous yet insightful manner – ‘Unlike the rest of the boys my age, **Gawls** is what I do when I am alone in my bedroom’.\n\nHis self-titled debut EP is a delightful collection of five electro-pop tracks, that grows in strength, and confidence as it goes on. There’s hints of Yeasayer and Vampire Weekend in the songwriting, be it the sombre drawl of _You’re Traditional_ or the more upbeat groove of _Young_. Check out the full EP below.",
