  "body": "Prior to hearing this sublime live track from **Beaufields**, I’m embarrassed to say that I wasn’t familiar with the Australian trio.\n\n_Lost At Last_ is a simply stunning piano driven ballad, forging crevasses in my heart that I didn’t know could exist. The vocals of lead singer **Hannah Cameron** are far and away some of the best live vocals I’ve ever heard, varying between fragile and bliss inducing, and desperately strained. I’m unsure as to what else I could possibly say to convey the sheer of beauty of this track, check out _Lost At Last_ below.",
