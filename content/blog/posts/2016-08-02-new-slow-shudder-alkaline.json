  "date": "2016-08-02T16:39:10",
  "body": "**Slow Shudder’s** debut track, Call You Back, cropped up on my radar a few months ago, and her latest offering, _Alkaline_ is another slice of beautifully honest downtempo pop.\n\nThere’s a real emotional fragility to the vocal and the songwriting, which when sets against the choppy, sample-led chorus, really allows the track to take on a life of its own. Check out Alkaline below.\n\nLike this? Follow our [On Repeat Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/crackintheroad/playlist/1UB6gJIZpmiO0H2zmSbg02) for a handpicked selection of the very best in new music; updated weekly.",
