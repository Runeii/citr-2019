Balancing these two strong elements is hard, and _XXX_ didn’t perhaps always have both eyes on the ball. _Old_, at least in reference to what **Brown** has to say about it, looks set to be a more focused body of work. _#HottestMC _ironically won’t appear in the LP, however it’s only exciting me further.",
