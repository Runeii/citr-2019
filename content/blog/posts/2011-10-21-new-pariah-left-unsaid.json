  "body": "_**Safehouses**_ was an incredible acheivement for a first EP.\n\nDebut single on **R&S** was also astounding – **_Detroit Falls_** is possibly one of the best debut singles I’ve heard by a producer. These days, **Pariah** has been keeping a bit quiet though, on the solo side of things. But that’s fair enough, seeing as he’s been buddying up with fellow fresher **Blawan** both collaboratively, under the moniker **Karenn**, and through setting up a record label together, **Works The Long Nights** (listen to previews of their first release [here](http://www.rubadub.co.uk/music/techno/sheworks-001 \"Rubadub\")).\n\nBut enough about that – he’s back, that’s what’s important. When I saw him DJ at a rawkus night at The Cellar in Oxford, he showed up fellow basshead **Gemmy**, who you could argue has been on the map for a lot longer. So why is this guy headlining? Probably because he’s one of the brightest sparks on the electronic music scene at the moment. I can see why he associates himself with **Blawan**, who I saw as the new Untold at the time – they both have their ears very close to the ground, **Blawan** taking a very matter-of-fact approach and developing his own aesthetic, whilst **Pariah** branches out, delivering a diverse range of productions that, at second glance, are incredibly well composed. They sound sculpted, the attention to detail near impeccable, and they’re alright in the club too. Not bad?\n\n_**Left Unsaid**_ has **Pariah** converging with the aforementioned **Untold** style. Drops and pauses, rapid, and very percussive. He’s put some nice chopped up vocals in there too. The lovely thing about this one though is the intense lift it creates – when that disorientating bass comes in after the second drop, you’ve gotta admit, you’re hooked. And there’s no resolve, it just keeps going – no letting down with this lad. I can even see him competing with **Ramadanman** once the track starts coming to close. According to **R&S**, this is going to part of a new compilation released on the 31st, entitled _**IOTDXI**_ (In Order To Dance ’11 I suppose) of which the second disc is full of fresh new tunes from **Lone**, **Bullion**, and a few other producers already mentioned in this article. Fuckin’ sweeeeet.\n\n_Listen to Left Unsaid below._",
