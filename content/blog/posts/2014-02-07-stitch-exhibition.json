Make sure to pop down to [Cock ‘n’ Bull Gallery](http://www.cocknbullgallery.com/) on Rivington Street before all the work is taken down!\n\nHere are some shots of the private view by [Scott Carthy](http://scottcarthy.co.uk/), with many more on the [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/stitchexhibitions). The lovely [Joshua Dean](http://joshuadean.tumblr.com/) and [Amy Webster](http://arwdesign.com/) also made a [SHORT FILM](https://vimeo.com/85750657) which really captures the evening.\n\nThe place was rammed past capacity, we rinsed the reserve drink stock and sold a few pieces. Stephen Webster presented the winner of the raffle with the stunning ‘Back With Hot Water Bottle’ piece by Silva+Cemin. Mark Hix and Tim Noble also showed up, despite it being on the same evening as Gary Webb’s private view. Success.\n\n![Stitchhigh058](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Stitchhigh058.jpg)[![13](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/13.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/15.jpg)[![15](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/15.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/15.jpg)[![Stitchhigh056](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Stitchhigh056.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Stitchhigh056.jpg)[![21](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/21.jpg)](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/21.jpg)\n\nThank you to the artists who made up this beautiful show, click on their names to see more of their work: [Ting Cheng](http://www.ting-cheng.com/), [Catheirne Scrivener](http://catscriv.wordpress.com), [Fiona Osborne](http://www.fionaosborne.com/), [Toni Hollowood](http://cargocollective.com/tonihollowood), [Heidi Andreasen](http://heidiandreasen.com/), [Silva+Cemin](http://silvapluscemin.com/gallery-one)",
