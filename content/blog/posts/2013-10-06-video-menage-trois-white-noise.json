  "body": "Having made their initial mark with a UB40 cover, Manchester’s bogans of death aka **Ménage à Trois** are steadily proving to be one of the UK’s most exciting new outfits.\n\nWith this beautifully shot video sure to gain them increased exposure, it’s a fitting tribute to the fantastic accompanying track. As with the previously featured videos by Hozier and Sunboy, _White Noise_ is a visual delight, and a real immersive experience that requires repeat viewing to truly digest. Shot in New York earlier in the year, there’s themes of jealously and adulation within this almost mythically conjured up world, all underpinned by one of the finest dance tracks of recent times. Comparison wise it’ll be almost impossible to avoid the Daft Punk references, yet it’s far from simply being a replica, and offers something mightily worthwhile in it’s own right. Check out the video below (make sure you watch it in HD).",
