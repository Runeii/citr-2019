  "body": "Minneapolis’s Gabriel Jorgensen was somewhat of a blog-buzz artist a few years back under his **Ancient Mariner** alias.\n\nNow, in true blog-worthy style, he’s undergone a rebrand of sorts, and is stepping out as **Dreamspook**, with a resoundingly more confident sound. The songwriting is bolder and more admirably tumultuous, merging seamlessly psych-pop elements from the likes of UMO and Tame Impala, _Fear In Love_ manages to feel like the perfect introductory track, leaving a real excitement for the direction of the full nine track release expected later this year. Check it out below.",
