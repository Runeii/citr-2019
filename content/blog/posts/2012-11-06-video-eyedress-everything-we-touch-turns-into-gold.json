  "body": "**Eyedress**’ rather lovely self-titled debut EP managed to exist quite comfortably in the 2012, ‘post chill-wave world’, despite the obnoxiousness of the term and the very fact that no one truly knows what it even defines, a dangerous combination of factors.\n\nThe video for one of the record’s highlights, _Everything We Touch Turns Into Gold,_ is a calmly glamorous insight into his world. It mourns greed, exuberance, beauty and apathy with a visual language that perhaps seems incidental, yet arguably still works.\n\nThe piece is directed by **Julius Valledor** and stars **Alessandra de Rossi** and **Eyeless** himself.\n\nDownload the EP **[HERE.](http://beko.bigcartel.com/product/eyedress)**",
