  "body": "Impressing with their [debut demo](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/23851-new-inner-oceans-ready-your-ghost/) back in August of this year, Denver quartet **Inner Oceans** are seeing out the year with the release of two more working ideas, _I Don’t Mind_ and _The Night_. As with their first outing, there’s hints at a movement towards a fully blown stadium ready masterpiece, yet maintains all the sincerity and honesty of a far more minimal composition. Of the two, I Don’t Mind stands out as a potential single, and given that they’ve only been together a matter of months, it’s a mightily exciting progression of their sound. Check out both new tracks below.",
