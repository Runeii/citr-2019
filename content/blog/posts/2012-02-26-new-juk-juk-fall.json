  "body": "Now Kieran Hebden (**Four Tet**) introduced this young London producer to the rest of the UK last year, releasing his excellent debut single _Winter Turns Spring_.\n\nNow **Juk Juk** is back with more mellow garage goodness – sampling away, once again. I assume it’s being released on his own label, or at least a new one, and one one side will be [this track](http://soundcloud.com/listenjukjuk/unwrap) (uploaded a couple of weeks ago) that samples Pitchfork Idol and recent Grammy King **Bon Iver**.\n\nFocusing on the more interesting track of the two – a smooth, mellow garage rhythm with tweaks in all the right places. The loud horn-like synth interrogates the track towards the end, ending things with a deeper tone than it started with. See what you think.\n\n_Listen to Fall below – out in March_.",
