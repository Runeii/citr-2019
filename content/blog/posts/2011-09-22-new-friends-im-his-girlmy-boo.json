  "body": "Unlike some, [**Friends**’](http://www.facebook.com/sdneirfbackwards) sassy and audacious brand of Rn’Pop wasn’t something that grabbed me from the beginning. Their early tracks, **_Feelin’ Dank_** and **_Friend Crash_** seemed thin in terms of vocals and lacked that punchy groove that I was looking for. Still, I felt alone, isolated even, so it was a great relief when the band dropped **_I’m His Girl_** about a week ago. The track is perhaps one of the most boisterously street smart and gloriously empowered pieces of pop I’ve heard in a long time. The bass line pumps and bops, while the actually pretty intricate vocal arrangements flirt and dictate to the listener, **_“when you see me walking around with him/I’m not just some other chick”._**\n\nThe single’s B-side compliments **_I’m His Girl_** Perfectly. The cover of **Ghost Town DJs’ _My Boo_** isn’t exactly the most polished cover ever, yet it’s fun and adventurous, two words that sum up the band perectly.\n\nStream the 2 tracks below and check out the band in London on the 27th (**The Hoxton Square Bar and Kitchen**) and 28th (**The Shacklewell Arms**) of September.",
