  "body": "Yet another Australian outfit, there’s little information around about **Ancients** right now.\n\nOne can assume that there’s a female vocalist or two involved, however aside from that, details are very scarce. New track, _Like Ghosts_ showcases the elegant, electro-pop vibe that we’ve seen emanating so heavily from down under recently, mixed with a more upbeat, dance orientated beat. Elsewhere, last year’s fantastic single _Dreamcatcher_ draws from the likes of Purity Ring, with it’s minimal albeit choppy composition. Check out a trio of tracks below, and more over on their [Bandcamp](http://ancientsau.bandcamp.com/album/dreamcatcher).",
