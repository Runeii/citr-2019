  "body": "My thoughts on this band:\n\n1) Lyrically, they’re horrendous (_‘I want to be with you, I don’t want to be alone’ ‘and I try to need you, but you didn’t trust me, you’re making me go a little bit crazy’_)\n\n2) They sound ridiculously like **The Drums**.\n\n3) The name **The Mono Polys** really infuriates me for no apparent reason. (Not technically about the music….)\n\nSo, with all that said, why am I then writing about them? Well, because somehow, they’re just plain and simply awesome. _I Want To Be With You_ is three minutes of frantic, upbeat indie pop, dripping with sickly sweet honey and lashed with half a kilo of sugar. Elsewhere on their debut EP, entitled _**LIFE**_,  you can expect much of the same; the **Joy Division** bassline of _Growing Old_ and the jagged riff of _You Think You Know It All_.\n\nI want to be annoyed at the pure simplicity of the tracks, but I just can’t, although the spoken sentence’s at the start of several of the tracks (_‘Some people think they know how to live their lives’_ – _You Think You Know It All_) are intensely dis-likeable, coming across as an even more cliched sample from Skins. Think **The Maccabees**, **Cajun Dance Party**, and of course **The Drums**, and you begin to understand the sort of harmless, guitar pop vibe that **The Mono Polys** strive for, and perfectly achieve.\n\n_**LIFE**_ is out now, check out a couple of tracks in this article, and head over to their [bandcamp](http://themonopolys.bandcamp.com/) to grab the full EP.",
