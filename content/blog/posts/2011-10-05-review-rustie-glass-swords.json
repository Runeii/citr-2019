  "body": "I want to start out by saying you can’t really go wrong if you’re Warp Records.\n\nThis year alone they’ve peddled some incredible records cherry-picked from the perfect roster: **Battles, Africa Hitech, Hudson Mohawke, Babe Rainbow, Prefuse 73, Brian Eno, Plaid, Grizzly Bear’s Chris Taylor**, and the exciting upcoming project from **Damon Albarn** (and his new buddies…**Actress**, **Kwes**, **Dr Who Dat?**) – **DRC Music**.\n\nBut after their release of last years **_Sunburst EP_**, there’s been an aftertaste left in our mouths for something more substantial from the Glaswegian producer. You know which one I’m talking about of course. **HudMo** seems to be loved for his campy indulgence in the current commercial US sound, but it’s **Rustie** who will come out on top this time around. He’s remixed almost everyone he admires, from **Zomby** to **PVT,** and he may have released a tune a while ago called **_Inside Pikachu’s Cunt_**, but this time he’s brought a dragon to a cockfight.\n\nFrom the crackling chimes on the album opener there’s immediate contrast with a hair-guitar solo – from here the pace picks up, but the ambience doesn’t let down. If there’s one thing to say about **Glass Swords**, it’s that it will continue to surprise you – it’s a retarded pastiche of genres. I can hear **Phil Collins** drums, synthesized sax, ‘Seinfeld’-like slap-bass…all set within a crystal pyramid of bass; an outstanding trifecta of hip-hop, dubstep and grime. Add to that equally subtle amounts of prog-rock, trance and funk, thrown in for good measure, and you’ve got yourself one of the most impressive electronic albums in recent years.\n\nI’ve got to say: the first few bars of some tracks here can throw you off – the trance set-up of Death Mountain quickly mutates into a crunchy hip-hop rhythm. Similarly, After Light dashes across rising synth chords into a bottomless chasm of trumpet-bass…and back again. Here, Rustie is a composer as much as producer, except this orchestra is from ‘Tron’.\n\nJust to set things straight though: this isn’t a sugary affair. The immediacy and aggressiveness of City Star shows the producer’s audacity to produce the perfect grime beat with no need for proper vocals – something Bristol’s **Joker** has haphazardly done with his debut (The Vision, 4AD). This album is a romantic testiment to the current British bass culture – Glasgow? London? Does it matter? – and a kick in the face of the ‘Pimp My Ride’ generation. At the same time it’s insular – **Rustie**’s treading ground that has only been breached previously by a handful of acts such as **Lone**, **Com Truise** and **Harmonic 313**, but with none of these with such focus and intensity.\n\nOf course there’s still always going to be comparisons to HudMo with this output, and others too (**Lunice, Dam-Funk**), but in my opinion **Rustie** goes further into the light. It’s an elevating experience to hear something with this amount of nostalgia for the eighties/nineties aesthetic without being too sickly sweet. There’s seems to be a weight to this sound that is hypnotic, almost. It may be the Sega 8-bit attack, or the 80’s prog allusions, but overall it doesn’t particularly matter. It’s fresh. If his previous yield was a bull-run, then **_Glass Swords_** is the china shop at the end of the street.",
