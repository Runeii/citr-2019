  "body": "An introspective listen on a rainy day- warm a cup of tea and sink into the depths of **Adrianne Lenker’s** _**Hours Were The Birds.**_\n\n_‘See you there softly moving, sweet around my pain, fixing my heart and my hands and my brain.’_\n\nWith the subtle confidence of a 21-year-old Berklee graduate on full scholarship, Lenker explores, minimally and elegantly, love loss and growing pain in purest form. Milky harmonies are teaming with movement and lyrical reflections of young love.\n\nFans of Sea of Bees and Iron & Wine are sure to find a kindred tenderness in Lenker’s saccharine voice.\n\nTreat yourself to the promising debut LP, Hours Were The Birds below.",
