  "body": "You may remember, (depending on how much of a Joel Chima super fan you are), that I flipped my shit when I heard the debut single to come from [**Ryan Power**’s](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/14695-new-ryan-power-i-don%e2%80%99t-want-to-die/ \"New: Ryan Power – I Don’t Want to Die\") new LP, **_I Don’t want to Die_**. What grabbed me, amongst other things, were the track’s simplicities. The gentle and somber production allowed the lyrics and themes to gently soak in, leaving for a truly moving experience.\n\n**Power**’s new track is quite the different beast. It trots along with flute like synths as its kitsch motivation, **Power**’s’ vocals again delivering in both range and frankly in weirdness.\n\n_I Don’t Want to Die_ will be released April 3 by [NNA Tapes](http://nnatapes.com/).\n\nVia [No Fear of Pop.](http://nofearofpop.net/2012/03/ryan-power-mondo-rush/)",
