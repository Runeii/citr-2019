Which is why I’m particularly happy to find one half of the duo, **Erlend Øye** (aka **The Whitest Boy Alive**, another no clicker)is seemingly turning his attention and clear talents to a new use, creating 70s Italo-pop pastiches.\n\n_La Prima Estate_ immediately sets itself up as firmly indebted to the works of that era, coming off as the soundtrack to every it’s-not-racist-it’s-just-a-bit-of-fun 70s comedy that ITV4 plays. The synth flute is delightfully weedy and the Italian lyrics successfully evoke the sentiment the track aims for – if incomprehensible to an ignorant like myself.\n\nSure, this isn’t going to top any of end of year lists, or going to set the blog-hype machine on fire, but these days that’s nicely refreshing. Coming at the end of July, it’s the perfect summer holiday track.\n\nShame it’s pissing it down.\n\n_By the way, answers on a postcard: what’s the name of that 80s detective series with an antique dealer in it that was seemingly always on reruns throughout my childhood? This sounds like a cut from that._\n\n\\[soundcloud url=”http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/102968415″ params=”” width=” 100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /\\]",
