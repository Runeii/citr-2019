The last couple of days may have heralded a return to the grey skies and light rain that we’ve come to expect from British summertime, but that doesn’t mean you have to stop having fun. To keep you in a sunny place, we’ve got you the first in our fortnightly summer playlist series, in which we’re gonna be getting some of our favourite artists to give you their top ten tracks for enjoying the glorious British weather (regardless of whether it’s any good or not). First up is **Theme Park**. Ahead of a string of festival appearances, from **Evolution** and **Field Day** this weekend through to **Latitude** in July and **Beacons** in August and more, the London four-piece have been kind enough to give us their very own soundtrack summer 2012.\n\nThese features are going to be running through to the end of August, and we’ve got some fantastic artists lined up, so stay tuned.",
