  "body": "Stockholm trio **Grapell**, consisting of Emil Erstrand, Joakim Wolfert and Nils Nygårdh, released their intoxicating three track debut EP on Strangers Candy last month.\n\nLet’s not beat around the bush here, there’s more than a touch of Radiohead to the group, in fact, White Fox In The Snow is more Thom Yorke than King of Limbs was, and arguably better. With lines like ‘_A little kiss behind the pole / A white fox in the snow / When someone held a weapon to your throat / Then I knew what to do_‘, lyrically it’s rather despairing at points, yet with an undercurrent of uplifting optimism. Of the three tracks, EP closer _Fire Between_ is the standout, a compelling love song that’s elegantly rounded and assured.",
