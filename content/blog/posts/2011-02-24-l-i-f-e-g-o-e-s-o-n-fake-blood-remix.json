Reflect this in the music itself, keeping the orchestration and sophistication of your darker moments, but infuse it with the catchy hooks of your earlier work.\n\nStep 2:  Get a big name DJ to remix it in to something that gets rid of all that and is half danceable (though there are moments that sound fairly similar to the Filthy Dukes remix of ‘To Lose my Life’, so never too far away from melodrama then)\n\nGet it here: [L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.
