  "body": "The phenomenon of an artist’s side-project being more impressive, engaging and altogether more fun than their main work is as tragic as it is intruiging.\n\nIt’s certainly what happened with James Mercer. The plodding mediocrity of **the Shins** over the last few years was, in 2010, eclipsed entirely by his team up with **Danger Mouse **to produce _Broken Bells_, the first and, to date, only LP from the band of the same name.\n\nUntil now, that is. With **Broken Bells**‘ second album, _After the Disco_, scheduled for released in January, the band have released their first single from it – ‘Holding on for Life’ is a piece of **Bee Gees**\\-esque brilliance – as weird as it is outright fun – and one that clearly allows Mercer to actually have fun with his vocals and songwriting for once. It’s a good start for what could be one of 2014’s first brilliant albums.",
