  "body": "Having unveiled his [fantastic debut EP](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/17854-review-mood-indigo-people-ep/) in September, Boston’s **Mood Indigo** is steadily building upon the eclectic spectrum of influences that initially attracted me to his debut track, _[Dive](http://admin.crackintheroad.com/music/17042-new-mood-indigo-dive/)_. New cut _Only You (Friend)_ returns to the sparse instrumentation and choppy hip-hop of the aforementioned track, throwing in a few vocal samples into the mix. A carefully constructed track, it’s further proof that this young musician is developing into quite a talent.",
