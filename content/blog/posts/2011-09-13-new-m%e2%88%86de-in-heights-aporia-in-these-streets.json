  "body": "I’d love to start an article wearing my self imposed ‘Taste Maker’ credentials firmly on my sleeve, detailing in full the history of **[Made In Heights](http://madeinheights.bandcamp.com)**. I would point out an inspired parallel between the duo’s back-story and their dream-focused sound; it would have been delightful.\n\nSadly the groups debut effort completely passed me by back in December of last year. I did, for the purpose of this article, go back and give it a listen. The results were hit and miss, especially after experiencing _**Aporia: In These Streets**,_ _a record that states very firmly from the off what it came to do__. **[Winter Pigeons (Songs To Raise Your Dead Spirits)](http://madeinheights.bandcamp.com/album/winter-pigeons-songs-to-raise-your-dead-spirits)**_ just feels underdeveloped in comparison.\n\nThe follow up from the duo, made up of Blue Scholars’ DJ/producer **Sabzi** and New York-based vocalist **Kelsey Bulkin**, is quite the treat. Made up of 6 originals and 5 separate instrumentals, it blends dream pop and trip hop sounds to form a blissed out stream of pop gems. Below are 3 highlights from the compilation.
