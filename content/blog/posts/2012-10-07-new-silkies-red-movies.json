  "body": "Exploding onto the blogosphere with their raucous debut track _Like One_ back in early August, Austin fuzz-pop group **Silkies** have unveiled the details of their first EP.\n\nSet to be released at the end of the month via new UK label Heart Throb and digitally by Young Latitudes, featuring the EP’s title track alongside two fresh cuts. Continuing with a similar slightly-gritty bubblegum punk (bubblegunk) attitude, it’s deliciously enjoyable, especially the nostalgic 60’s inspired _Movies_. Check out the full EP below, and purchase a [cassette here](http://heartthrobrecords.bandcamp.com/album/like-one-ep).",
